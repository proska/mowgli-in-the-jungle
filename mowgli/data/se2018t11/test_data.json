I slipped my feet into my slippers and looked at the clock. It was only 7:00 but it was time for me to get my newspaper and drink some coffee. I looked out the window and noticed it was raining quite a bit. I saw the newspaper at the end of my driveway, as far away as it could be. I grabbed my umbrella out of my coat closet and opened my front door enough to stick the umbrella through and open it outside. I stepped out the door and quickly covered my head with the umbrella. Then I ran to the end of my driveway, scooped up the newspaper in its plastic wrapping, and ran back to my front door. I closed my umbrella, took off my slippers, and dried off. Then, I unwrapped my newspaper and sat down to read it.",

So, we are having five people, and one person in the high chair. Then, we go get the five placemats out of the side cabinet. After we set the placemats neatly at chair. After we set a placemat at each chair, we go get the plates. Mom, Dad, Grandma, and Grandpa all get big plates, but Tom is still little, so he gets a small plastic plate. We set a plate on each placemat. Now we need a napkin for each place. Luckily, we still have some napkins left over from the birthday party last week, so we will use those. It doesn't matter that they say \"Happy Birthday.\" We put a folded napkin to the left side of each plate. On top of each napkin we put a fork. Except for Tom, he gets a small fork. On the right side of the plate we put a knife and spoon. We need to be careful with the knives. Closer to the center of the table we put a glass by each plate. Tom gets a plastic glass, because he isn't ready for a real glass one yet. We are ready to eat!",

My mother told me it was time for me to learn, so we both got into the car, and drove to a part of my neighborhood that was sort of empty. There were not a lot of people living in this section, so it was more of a big area for me to practice. We got to the area, and we both got out of the car and switched seats. It felt very cool finally being in front of a steering wheel. I released the emergency brake, and put the car in drive, and did what my mom told me to do. We mainly drove around in circles and practiced driving in straight lines and making turns. After a few minutes practicing my turns, I put the car in reverse and practiced backing up. I made sure to look behind me to see if there was anyone, just so I knew it was safe. It felt very cool to have finally driven a car, and my mom told me how good of a job I did.",

First, I chopped my onion and put it into the big pot with some olive oil. I stirred them frequently while they cooked. Next, I added some garlic into the pot. I then added some ground beef. I mixed it together and let it cook until it was browned. I then added a big carton of beef stock, some water, and a can of stewed tomatoes. I then chopped my bell peppers into small pieces and added them to the pot. I let the soup slowly boil until the peppers were soft. At the end, I threw in a handful of Italian bread crumbs and some Parmesan cheese for some flavor. I was so excited to serve up a bowl and eat it.",

Then, I seasoned flour with all time spice. Now, one by one I coated fish in seasoned flour and set aside. I put them in refrigerator for half an hour. After hour, I put the big flat pan on stove over 350 degrees. When It became hot enough, I slowly put pieces of fish one by one, next to each other. Did not overcrowd them. I let it cook each side for at least 3 to 4 minutes, and then turned them over, and cooked another 3 minutes on medium temperature. It was very crispy and delicious.",

There was a lake and some biking trails so we would bring our swimsuits and our bicycles. The website said that the campground was first come first serve so we decided to get there early, around 3pm. We loaded the car with the tent and sleeping bags and some food to grill over the fire. When we got to the campground they assigned us a spot near the lake. We went to the campsite and unloaded our tent and set it up. We purchased some firewood at the store so we could have an evening fire. With things all ready for sleeping we put on our swimsuits and headed down to the lake. After our swim we went back to the campsite and started our fire. We made a nice dinner and read some stories before we went to bed. In the morning we rode our bikes on the bike trails and when we got back we pulled down the tent and packed up the car. It was a lovely camping experience.",

I get some thread and a sewing needle and get to work. I carefully put the button on my shirt, and start sewing. I tie a knot on the end of my thread, and put the needle through the underside of my shirt to where the button is. I guide the needle from under the shirt through one of the holes in the button, and then back through another hole. I do this many times, alternating between the four holes to make sure the button's on tight. There are a lot of ways you can sew a button, but I like to do it so the stitch looks like an X. Once I've done it enough times, I can tie off my thread and my button's as good as new!",

Then I grabbed my nephew and took off his pants and unsnapped his onesie.  He was awfully wriggly, so I knew I'd have to do this quickly!  I took off his dirty diaper. Then, I took out a wipe from the container and wiped his backside.  When I was sure he was clean enough, I put the clean diaper under him and sprinkled baby powder over him.

I got out of my car and took note of the gasoline pump number before walking into the gas station and telling the store clerk I need $45 worth of gas on pump number 3 and then handed her $45 cash. I walked back out to the gas pump and made sure my vehicle was completely off before removing the gasoline cap on my car. I lifted the gasoline nozzle from the gas pump and stuck it into the gas hole on my car. I was now ready to pump gas. I squeezed the gasoline nozzle on the pump handle and held the nozzle firmly as I waited for all the gasoline to be pumped into my car. Once the gasoline pump signaled that I was finished pumping, I slowly took the gas nozzle out of my car and put it back on the nozzle holder located on the gas pump. I screwed the gasoline cap back onto the gas hole on my car before getting back into my car and driving away.",

I look at my shelf of movies and find the one I want to watch. I open the DVD case and remove the DVD. I walk toward my TV and find my DVD player. I turn my DVD player on and hit the \"open\" button. The DVD player pops open. I place the DVD into the open slot. I then push the slot closed. I turn on my TV and switch from cable to HDMI. The movie is playing through the opening trailers. I wait 20 minutes until they play through and it brings me to the opening screen. I grab my remote and press the \"OK\" button while on the \"play\" option. The movie begins to play.

We have been looking forward to go out all week because my husband has been very busy with work all week and hasn't really had any time to relax. I have been swamped at work also; but I took time out of work early that Friday to get ready. I want to pull out all the stops and look as if  we were going out when we were boyfriend and girlfriend. I arrive home early and pull out the new dress I bought ages ago just for an occasion as tonight. I am in the process of getting ready, when my husband arrives home and is excited as well. He tells me after dinner that he has a surprise for me. So I get more excited and hurry to finish getting ready. He is ready in twenty minutes and is waiting while I take another twenty to get ready. When I walk downstairs he looks at me as if we were still going out and that puts a smile on my face immediately. Tonight is going to be a good night, I thought to myself as he grabs my hand. We make our reservations to the Italiano restaurant  on time and have a wonderful dinner and enjoy our time together. He can't take his eyes off of me and I can't either. Then after dinner, he takes me to his surprise, which is dancing at a small jazz club he recently discovered. We dance the night away, enjoying every moment. Knowing that this date will never end since we already live together and are happily married.",

Once in the laundry room, I pulled out the clothes one by one and started separated them into different piles. There was one pile for colors, and another for whites. The colors would go into the washer first. I added the clothes and measured out the correct amount of detergent needed for the size of the load, and poured it into the reservoir. I turned the dial to be on Colors and pressed start. When the washer was done after 30 minutes, I moved the washed clothes to the dryer. I added a dryer sheet, checked that the lint trap was empty, and started the dryer on the setting for Automatic dry, low heat. I then placed the whites into the washer, added detergent, and started the washer on the setting for whites. When the dryer was finished, I took out the clothes and brought them upstairs to be folded and put away. I moved the whites into the dryer and set them to dry. When they finished, I also brought them upstairs to fold and put away.",

Luckily , they were not and I was told to come right in . I drove to the salon and checked in with the receptionist at the front desk . I was told to take a seat and that someone would be with me shortly . I was only seated for a few minutes when the hairdresser said that she was ready for me . She led me over to a chair and I sat down . We discussed what I wanted to do with my hair , a trim , and then she took me to the shampoo area . My hair was washed and conditioned and then I was led back to the hairdresser 's chair . She combed my hair out and then cut off the split ends a few small sections at a time . I saw little wisps of my hair fall onto the floor . When the hairdresser was finished cutting , she took out a blow dryer and dried my hair . I looked in the mirror and I was very pleased with my haircut . I walked back over to the receptionist and paid for the cut . I added about twenty percent as a tip to reward the hairdresser for doing a great job . I left the hair salon and drove home .",

I feel like I was more nervous then my brother! I quickly showered and pulled on my suit, before heading down to the ceremony. I pulled aside my brother and gave him a hug. I told him how proud of him I was, and how happy I was for his bride to become a part of our family. He thanked me and we made our way down. I took my place up front, and as the seats began to fill, I could not have been happier. I saw the smiles on everyone's face. I barely remember anything the pastor said during the ceremony. I just stood their, grin from ear to ear. It was the first and last time I have ever cried tears of joy.",

We talked to the employees to find out which trees grow well in our area and in the type of soil we have . We chose a small maple seedling . When we got home , we chose an area of our yard with lots of sun . We dug a hole just a little bigger than the roots of our seedling . We put the seedling in the hole in the ground very carefully , then covered the roots with dirt . We patted the dirt down really good to make sure the little tree seedling would be stable in the ground when it was windy . Then we watered the tree . We 've been watching and watering our tree for a year and slowly but surely our little tree is growing .",

I had a bag of oranges in the fridge so I pulled them out and cut them in half then I realized I couldn't find my juicer. I had my heart set on fresh juice and I decided to blend them. I cut the skins off of the oranges and put the skins down my sink to run them through the garbage disposal. I added all of the fruit to my blender pitcher and slowly started pulsing to see if they would catch the blade. I then pushed the blend button and held the lid. I blended until it looked like everything was liquefied and poured it into cups. The blended orange juice was even better than regular juiced orange juice, it was frothy and whipped and reminded me a little bit of an orange julius.",

I marked the spot I wanted to put the nail in with the piece of chalk I had. I carefully put the nail on the spot, then took my hammer and hit it a few times. When I checked to make sure it was going in straight, I kept hammering it in. I hammered it in until it was half way in the wall and half way not. I put the hammer down.

I drove my pickup truck to a nursery near where I live . They had many different types of trees there , all growing in large pots . The trees were very skinny , but I knew once they were out of the pots and planted in the ground , they would grow into large trees . I found some cherry trees and saw how much they would cost . I asked a man who worked at the nursery if he would put the tree in my pickup after I paid for it . I went to the cashier and paid for the tree and the man loaded it into my truck . When I got home , I got a shovel and dug a huge hole where I wanted the tree to grow . I made sure all the big rocks and roots from other trees were not left in the hole . I added some manure so the roots would get all the extra nutrients a growing tree would need . In the middle of the hole I made the soil higher in the shape of an upside down cone . I took the tree out of my truck and removed it from the pot . I stood the tree up in the middle of the hole , with the tree on the top of the cone and the roots spread out around it . This would make sure the tree would not be standing in water and the roots could drink the water easily . I replaced the dirt , making sure the tree was even with the ground around the hole . When the hole was all filled up I stomped all around the tree to make sure the roots of the tree were firmly connected with the soil . When I was sure the tree was firmly in the ground and would not move , I got my garden hose . I turned on the water and slowly watered the tree . After a few hours , I watered it again . When all the water had sunk into the ground , I put a few inches of mulch all around the tree to keep the roots moist and stop weeds from growing . I knew that I would have to water the the tree every week until the roots got established . The tree will get bigger every year , and I 'm looking forward to the day when I 'll be able to pick cherries in my own back yard !",

So first in a bowl I cracked 4 eggs one by one. Then with fork I whipped them for a while when they mixed very well, but did not overdo. I turned on my stove, put the nonstick pan on and  turned stove on medium heat. Meanwhile I got some cheese and salsa out for extra flavor. When the pan was hot enough, I added 2 tablespoon of unsalted  butter( I love butter), and then I did not wait it to be hot, but immediately poured my eggs into pan. The pan was already hot, so I started to bubble and cook. In a minute, I started to stir my eggs, added some cheese and salsa, salt and some pepper. I stirred the eggs till they became fluffy and cooked. When all moisture disappeared, I moved pan from stove, transferred it to plate.",

I decided to take my large suitcase and a smaller travel bag.  I laid out everything I wanted to take before I started putting the items in my bag.  First I put in a pair of pants.  Beside my pants, I put in three pairs of shorts.  I added two casual dresses on top of the pants.  Then I put in three folded t-shirts, two tank tops and a linen blouse.  On top of that layer I added two bathing suits and a cover up.  I put my underclothes on the top layer along with a pair of pajamas.  In the front section of my suitcase I put in two pairs of sandals, a pair of flip flops and a pair of tennis shoes.  That was all that fit into the larger suitcase.  I put my toiletries into the smaller bag - shampoo, conditioner, toothpaste, toothbrush, makeup and deodorant.  I realized I had forgotten beach towels so I got a large tote bag that I could also carry to the beach and put two towels in there along with a bottle of sunscreen.  Now I was all ready for my beach trip!",

I turned on the water in the shower and waited for it to heat up. Then I stepped in and started to wet my hair. When my hair was completely wet I reached for the shampoo bottle and squeezed a small amount into my hand. Then I rubbed this shampoo into every part of my hair. I scrubbed and scrubbed allowing the bubbles to get really big. Then it was time to make my hair really clean. I let the water run all the way over my hair and I kept pushing it through until I could feel that my hair was squeaky clean. I turned the water off. My hair was now clean. I found a towel and wrapped it around my head so that my hair could dry. When I had gotten dressed I used the hairdryer to completely dry my hair. Now when I looked in the mirror my hair was shiny and sparkling. It was perfectly clean.",

It makes me feel peaceful to sit and watch the fish as they drift and swim around. I have taken great care in selecting the fish that go into the tank, to make sure they will all get along. There is an expert at the fish store who gives me instructions on how to make sure the fish are happy and healthy in their environment. Part of the daily regimen is feeding the fish the best food I can get for them. I love to lift the lid of the tank and sprinkle their special food onto the surface of the water. The fish rise to the surface and begin to eat the food. They know it's dinner time, based on my motions and the lifting of the lid. I know just how much food to give them in order to keep the fish happy and satisfied.",

I felt compelled to talk to everyone, including people that I really didn't know. I enjoyed the ceremony with my significant other and gave my gift to the bride and groom. I had a great conversation with everyone and talked about how extravagant the ceremony was. I had a great time and felt that I had great conversation with everyone.  I was extremely excited to see family that I had not seen in forever and was excited that people came from all over to see the bridge and groom. Overall, it was a great experience.",

I felt that I made the bed well and my bed looked much more orderly than it looked prior to making it.

That's so I don't forget him, I guess. I always wash his bowl first. Then I dry it, and pour in a scoop of kibble. I put a chunk of canned cat food on top of that, less than a quarter of a flat can. Next, I put the bowl on the floor and stand back. He runs to the bowl and starts eating as fast as he can. He eats all the soft food on the top as fast as lightning. Then he takes his time with the kibble, eating more and more slowly until its gone. When he finally finishes  he slinks away. Then I wipe up the floor, because Max is not a tidy eater.",

He had been advised by a tree expert , that the best time to plant it was in April or May . So about several weeks after Tom had moved into his new home , he went ahead to plant the tree in mid April . He first got and checked some maps to make sure he did n't mistakenly end up digging into any telephone or gas lines . Once he found a suitable spot to plant his new tree , Tom took a shovel and began preparing the hole to place it in . Next , he prepared the tree for planting by turning carefully upside down to remove it from the pot it came in . He then gently , placed the tree into the hole . Tom also filled the hole with some compost and manure to help the tree grow better . Once this was done , he filled up the hole completely and watered the tree . Finally , he placed mulch on top and then stopped to admire the beautiful new tree in his yard .",

After enough time was spent doing this, i asked my dad if he could take me out to drive out on an open road for practice, and he said yes. Once we took the car out to an open, empty road, I tried my best to show him what I'd learned. I showed him that I knew how to shift gears, use the parking brake, and showed that I was able to make both smooth and sharp turns, along with keeping an eye on things like the speed limit, gas tank reserves, and so on. He seemed to be very impressed with how I did, so he allowed me to get my learner's permit so that I could legally learn how to drive on the street with other people, as long as he or my mom was in the car with me. This is just one step closer to getting my license.",

We went outside to see if we had enough firewood and discovered that we didn't have enough wood for our fire. I decided to go out into the forest to pick up some more wood while my sister used the wood we had to get a fire started. I walked around for ten minutes picking up any stray logs, branches or twigs that I could find. Once I had gathered a decent amount of firewood, I went back to find my sister and see how the fire was coming. She had gotten a pretty good start but the fire definitely needed some more wood. I took the branches I had gathered them and made them into a teepee formation on top of the fire my sister had started. The branches quickly lit and our fire was huge in no time! We enjoyed our night out by the fire and cooked some hot dogs and made s'mores at the end of the night.",

A few days ago, I noticed that the deadlines for May were coming up, so yesterday I decided to just tackle all of my payments. I got out my checkbook and a ballpoint pen. I wrote one check to the heat company for $120, one check to the water company for $100, and one check to the gas company for $130. I then stuffed each check into a separate envelope, wrote the addresses of the companies onto their respective envelopes, and dropped off the envelopes into the mail pickup box.",

One of the first things I decided to do was paint the living room walls.  The walls were currently painted an ugly yellow and the paint was peeling.  I went to the paint store and looked over the paint colors.  I settled on a calming blue.  I figured out how much paint I would need by calculating the area of the room, then I bought enough gallons to cover the job.  I left the store and loaded the paint and supplies I bought into my car.  After getting home, I spread a plastic drop cloth over the floor and got the paint ready.  I took a brush and dipped it in the paint and spread it over the wall.  This was going to look much better!",

I searched YouTube to find a good simple but interesting set of instructions . I decided on a chocolate cake as I am weak when it comes to resisting chocolate . I gathered all of the ingredients and placed them on the counter along with measuring cups and spoons . I could not believe how much sugar goes into the baking of a cake but that 's why it 's not a health food . All the ingredients went into a bowl for me to mix with a 1980 's hand held electric mixer . While the over was preheating I scooped a the mixture into a well greased baking pan . Naturally my finger stole a taste of the raw cake . After placing the bowl in the oven and and waiting the proper time I removed the cake and frosted it after it cooled down . Not too bad for a non baker but I 'll stick to cooking .",

I knew that I was going to need something that would fill my empty stomach up, so I decided to make an omelette. I opened the fridge and grabbed a carton of eggs and some mixed vegetables I chopped up last night. Then I opened the cabinet to get a bowl to mix my eggs in. I scrambled the eggs up with a fork, and then got a pan to put on the stove to cook the eggs in. After I turned on the stove, I put some a little bit of oil in the pan so the eggs wouldn't stick. I hate when that happens, it always makes cleaning up after really hard! Then I poured the eggs from the bowl into the pan and waited for the eggs to start to firm up. I poked at them with a spatula, pushing parts from the edge of the pan that were kinda firm slowly towards the middle of the pan. The uncooked runny eggs slide over to where the firm eggs were and cook up really quick! When there was no more runny eggs left, I turned off the stove and spread my mixed veggies on one side of the omelette. Then I used my spatula to fold the omelette in half so that the mixed veggies were in between the sides of the omelette, kind of like a sandwich. I put my omelette on a plate and took it over to my table to sit down and eat. My stomach roared like a lion when I looked down at the omelette. I think it took me less than a minute to eat the whole thing!",

I offered to drive it there for him if he would fly me back.  My friend agreed.  I started driving early in the morning.  I had to go to a gas station to fill up and to wipe off the windows.  I merged onto a freeway and saw that there was hardly any traffic.  I set the cruise control and turned the music up.  I wasn't paying too much attention to the speed that I was going, and I passed a cop on the side of the road.  The cop got behind me and turned on his lights.  I pulled over.  He came to my car to explain that I had been speeding.  I apologized, and the cop decided to let me go with a warning.",

I know we all like Japanese food, so I check Yelp for nearby Japanese restaurants with high ratings and reasonable prices. Once I find one that looks good, I check the menu to make sure there are options we would all like. Yum, the menu looks great. There are vegetarian options available for me, chicken options for my dad, and fish for my mother. I call the restaurant, requesting a reservation for Saturday at 6pm for three for dinner. The restaurant luckily enough does have a table available for the time I requested. The reservation will be under my last name. My parents and I are all set for dinner Saturday: I'm looking forward to eating Japanese food and talking to them! I think my parents will like their surprise.",

I just moved to a new neighborhood and there are some public tennis courts in the park across from my apartment.  I decided to take some tennis lessons during the winter to make sure that I would be ready to play when spring came.  I really enjoyed the lessons and I actually became a pretty good player.  I decided to join a recreational tennis league in my neighborhood.  I joined a women's singles league and I have had a really good time playing tennis once or twice a week.  It's very convenient to meet right at the neighborhood courts and play tennis for an hour in the evenings.  I even decide dot treat myself to a brand new tennis racket.

We begin to play the match. Tennis involves hitting a ball with something called a \"tennis racket\". This racket allows you to swing and hit a ball over a net. The goal is to avoid hitting the net, and hit the ball so that it is difficult for your opponent to hit the ball back to you. However, if your opponent hits the ball, he must also make sure the ball doesn't touch the net. Both of you may hit the ball off the ground, reflecting it into the air yet you must avoid the net. If your opponent hits the next or makes the ball go out of bounds, then you score a point. The objective is to make your opponent hit the net as many times as you can.",

We'd both heard they had good Al Pastor, so he ordered the Al Pastor burrito and I ordered an Al Pastor quesadilla. After waiting quite long, nearly 30 minutes, we finally received our food. It's true that the Al Pastor was tasty but it was also spicy! Insanely spicy! It as so spicy that neither Steve or I could actually eat it. After a few bites we were gulping down water and calling the waiter to come back over. I apologized and asked if we could switch the dish for something with a similar price. Steve added that the dish was so hot, it should come with a warning. Our server apologized and agreed to bring us the same dishes, but with shredded steak instead of the Al Pastor. The new dishes came out more quickly than the first two and were much more edible.",

My mom left me instructions how to boil the milk for her. I got a big pan and put it on the oven. I turned on the oven and made the pan hot by turning the dial to high. Once the pot was hot enough I poured the milk inside, I poured around half of it. After a while the milk started to get hot, which I could see because it would move and I saw steam. When bubbles started appearing in the milk, I knew it was boiled and done.",

I gathered together a cleaning sponge, a shower cleaning spray, a rinse cup, and a towel to dry my hands.  First, I removed everything I could from the shower such as shampoo bottles, soap, and razors.  Next I sprayed the shower with a shower cleaner.  I allowed this to stay on the walls about five minutes.  Then I took a wet sponge and began rubbing the tub and shower walls with a circular motion.  Soon it all looked sparkly so I took my rinse cup and filled it with water.  I used this to wash off all the soap from the walls.  I checked to make sure I didn't miss any spots.  I placed the shampoo, soap, and razors back into their spots.  I dried my hands, and I was done.",

On my way to work I stopped at the grocery store and bought a pack of replacement bulbs. When I got home from work I opened the new package of bulbs and carefully screwed the new bulb in. It immediately lit up when the contacts connected. Figuring that the other three bulbs were the same age and would probably blow out soon I decided to change the rest of them.

When I like the temperature of the water, I get in and use the soap to lather up with the wash cloth.  I then wash my hair and rinse it.  I put in some conditioner for my hair and let it sit for a few minutes, as I finish scrubbing my body down.  Then I rinse the conditioner and my body for the last time, an turn the water off.  When I get out, I dry my body with my towel, put on my pajamas, and go to bed.",

I spoke with my dad and sister and my dad told me that in order to not get ripped off, you have to constantly check the prices of airfare and keep checking often. He said that prices tend to be cheaper on certain days of the week and you should clear your search history to avoid the airlines keeping the prices high. I made the reservation after reviewing the prices and received a good deal. This took a lot of work and required me looking around at different airlines for the perfect fight. While this process was somewhat long and difficult, I felt great that I was able to get a good deal and save a lot of money. Unfortunately, I also had to pick seats and pay more and also pay more for bags.",

I filled the mug with water and put the tea bag in it. I put the mug in the microwave oven on high for two minutes. I then put the mug on a saucer and let it sit for ten or fifteen minutes until the tea got darker.

I was embarrassed by this  set up, but it was better than not dating at all.   My sister said we would go see a movie at the local cinema on Saturday at 6PM.  Our parents wanted me home by 11 PM.  On Saturday I was so excited and started getting ready very early.  My sister told me to calm down that i was getting ready way too soon.  So I took off my clothes and put on something different.  Finally the time came to get ready and I was excited again.  We left the house at 4:30 and picked up my friend.  He was so handsome! By 5:00 we were at the ice cream shop where we met up with her boyfriend and had ice cream.  Then we went to the movies. My sisters boyfriend purchased popcorn and sodas for all of us.  We munched, drank and watched the movie.  Once it was over we went to the mall and ate at the food court and went and played video games at the arcade. Around 10 PM we were ready to leave.  My sister kissed her boyfriend goodbye and me and my friend piled back into my sisters car.  She dropped him off at his house about 10:15 and he gave me a peck on the cheek.  My sister raised her eyebrow but didn't say anything.  Around 10:30 we showed up to our house where my mom wanted to know everything that went on.  I was in 7th heaven and told her the entirety of the story.  Except maybe the kiss.",

After gathering the shovel and watering hose , and putting on my gardening gloves , I set to work on digging the hole . I had to make sure the hole was deep enough to fit its roots comfortably . I dampened the soil in the hole with a little water . Once the hole was ready , I laid the tree on its side and gently removed the pot from it . I placed the sapling into the hole and looked to see that the base of its trunk would be level with the ground , then began scraping the soil back into the hole , over the roots . I tamped the soil down , so as to prevent any air pockets , and watered it once more . I think this little tree will make a wonderful addition to my yard !",

One of the crew didn't make it back! But the salmon we caught did. We took this beautiful salmon back to the shore and cooked it. Then we all partook in eating the salmon fish. It was a delight, with butter and garlic, and salt too. It was flaky and moist and very tasty. It was enjoyed by all of the party who then began to digest the salmon. The salmon even digested very well and all were pleased.",

I put about a tablespoon of butter in the pan and turned on the heat to melt it, then added the onions and garlic to saute.  While they cooked, I cut up the vegetables.  I cut carrots into thick slices, and potatoes into one inch cubes, leaving the skin on for extra vitamins. Fresh green beans were trimmed and cut into one inch lengths. Then I put the vegetables in the soup pan and stirred them before adding six cups or so of water and heating it to a boil. Turning it down to simmer, I let it cook until the vegetables were soft enough to eat.",

I always make sure to get every part of my body clean and then I take the shampoo and wash my hair. I usually stand there after and enjoy a few minutes of just letting the water hit me. After washing my hair, I usually get out and get a towel and start to dry myself. The whole process usually takes about fifteen minutes, but it is an enjoyable experience. Sometimes I listen to music when I am in the shower, but I usually just enjoy my warm shower without music.",

I went to the refrigerator to look for the ingredients we would need. I pulled out some potatoes I had already boiled, carrots, heavy cream, milk, sour cream, chives, bacon bits, butter, and flour. I began by making a roux in the pan by mixing the butter and the flour together. Once my roux was done, I added the heavy cream and milk to the pan. I let the heavy cream and milk mixture come to a simmer and then I added sour cream and cheddar cheese. After that, I added my boiled potatoes and the chopped up vegetables. Once the soup was thickened, I topped it with bacon bits and chives. I poured a bowl of soup for both me and my boyfriend and topped them with sour cream. We ate our soup and enjoyed what we made.",

He gave me a quick flash of his headlights to signal that he saw me, He made his way to the side of the street. So I opened the door and got inside. I said to the driver, \"let's go to the main street, Sooner the better.\" The driver turned on his signal to merge into the traffic. It's weird how some people yield to merging traffic, while others ignore them. I think it must be a personality thing, but it's always safer to yield. No need to drive aggressively. The driver drives at a casually fast pace, weaving in and out of lanes as needed. We got to the main street in about 10 minutes. Guess it's time to pay the man. \"Thanks, driver, for getting here right quick,\" I said. I opened the door and got out.",

After we were finished setting up our camp, we got our fishing polls and went down to the lake.  We caught a couple of fish for dinner.  We put the fish in the cooler and then went swimming for a bit.  After swimming, we cleaned the fish and went back to the camp sight.  We cooked the fish over the camp fire.  Next, we roasted marshmallows.  We sat around the camp fire and talked.  We went to bed around 10:30 pm.",

I got out a carton of eggs and a carton of milk.  When I make scrambled eggs, I also like to put salt and pepper in it.  I got a mixing bowl and put in about five eggs and a cup of milk.  I put a couple shakes of salt and pepper in it, too.  I got a fork out and mixed the ingredients together in the bowl.  When they were all mixed together, I got out a pan and put it on a stove burner.  I turned it on and put the mixture onto the pan and cooked it on a low setting.  When they were done, I pulled them out of the pan with a spoon and onto a plate to eat.",

I first made sure my swimming trunks were clean and ready to wear along with making sure I had all my other belongings I like to take out to the pool in one place before I walked over to the pool from my house. I always like to take some sunscreen, an ice chest filled with cold beverages, and a spare towel. I gathered all my things and locked my house up before walking a few blocks to get to the pool. Once I got to the swimming pool I found a nice sunbathing chair to neatly place my personal belongings under and took off my shirt to apply sunscreen on my body. After putting the sunscreen on I was ready to relax and enjoy my day by the pool.",

I brought my shirts, my pants, my underwear, and my socks. I brought enough for a week's worth of clothes, which is how long I'm going to be staying somewhere else. Then, I went into the bathroom and got my toothbrush and a tube of my toothpaste, so I wouldn't have to get new ones where I'm going.

After researching and finding one online I was well on my way to going to see my friend Paul . I drive to the station and decide that I am going to purchase a round trip ticket as this would be cheaper than just buying both tickets separately . I purchase my ticket and then go to sit down and wait for my train . Whenever my train arrives I have to get in line as they process our tickets . After all this is done I decide to take a seat by the window . I sit and fall asleep a bit as I ride on the train for hours . After a couple hours we finally reach the destination and I get off the train , excited to see my friend .",

The appetizers were amazing so we were both so excited to see how our entrees would be. I ordered a rack of lamb and my boyfriend ordered the steak. However, as soon as our server brought the food, I could see that something was wrong. Instead of a rack of lamb, our server had brought me a whole entire fish on a plate! As soon as our server set the plate down in front of me, I politely informed him that I had ordered the lamb and that I did not want to eat the fish. He apologized profusely and quickly brought the fish back to the kitchen. In just a minute, he came back with a beautiful rack of lamb which was delicious.",

Jerry has never done this before, so he sits down on the bed near his mom and asks her what to do.  She says,  \"Wait here while I pick out my clothes I will bring.\" She jumps up and reaches for the dresser.  She opens up the drawers and picks some nice clothes to wear on her trip.  She will also need things like shoes, and toothpaste, shampoo and soap.  So, she has a separate bag for those things, and once it is filled up she puts the clothes in her big bag with Jerry's help.She puts her smaller bag with her soap and toothpaste, into the big bag last. She makes everything really neat and tidy in the bag, and then closes the bag up with the zipper. She puts the bag near the door so that she knows where it is when it is time to go.",

He didn't answer and  just gave me a grin.  I tend to sleep till late on the days I don't have school. He said dad told him to and he had work for me. I immediately knew what it meant. I had to go and help him tend the gardens. I was still half- asleep when I reached our garden. And there I saw my dad with a shovel in his one hand and a little plant on the other. As soon as he saw me his eye gleamed. I kid you not his eyes literally gave me a sparkle. He came over to the door and handed me the shovel and the plant. He said since I was 11 I'm a big boy and have to help him and mom around the house and that of course includes gardening. My dad doesn't mind the dirt , but I do. Now I had to spend the whole afternoon helping him around. It sucks.",

The living room was fine, but the kitchen was a disaster. I felt the need to clean the floor and in an effort to do so, I took out a mop and mopped up the floor. This took some of the stickiness away and made it feel much better. I sprayed cleaner on the floor before cleaning it and also did some sweeping. This felt good and I was able to clean the floor. After sweeping and mopping the floor, I let it sit for a while so  that I didn't slip on it. It looked shiny and I felt like my house was much cleaner than when my friends came over. Next time, I will follow the same routine when cleaning.",

I put some water into the iron that turns into steam. Steam helps to take wrinkles out of clothes. Once the ironing board is set up I turn on the iron and give it time to heat up, about 2 minutes. Once heated up I put the pants on the ironing board. I start with the top part of the pants first and move or turn the pants after I iron each side. The I iron the leg part of the pants. I line up the leg part of the pants on the ironing board the way I want so that the crease will be the same. Once done I put everything away. The end.",

The bottom of the bag hadn't broken or leaked, that was good news! Now that my trash bag was secure and not going to make a mess on the floor, I walked outside and set the full trash bag out for the garbage collector. I walked back into my home and into the kitchen.

The lady sold me a ticket and then directed me through the gate with the turn style entry. I walked down several flights of stairs that had a central corner landing. A man sat cross legged playing guitar, he seemed very happy with his life, I dropped a pound coin into his upside down hat in front of him, he smiled and I smiled back. I continued down the stairs to king's cross and awaited the train I would be boarding. After about 17 mins the train was heard approaching. The train screeched to a halt at the platform on the southbound side where I was. Once all of the patrons exited the train I boarded and sat next to a bald woman with a pet iguana on her shoulders. The subway smelled of urine and B.O. but it was cheap and I liked people watching, especially in a foreign city at thirteen years old.",

We had been meaning to go to the movie theater for a long time, since have both been anticipating the release of the smash hit \"La La Land\" for months. La La Land is now finally in theaters, and my friend and I decided that the weekend would be the perfect time to see it. We went to the theater about 30 minutes before the movie started in order to purchase our tickets. We both got adult tickets for the movie. We then waited in line at the concessions stand, because we wanted to buy sodas, popcorn, and candy. My friend bought a Coke and a large popcorn, as well as a bag of Skittles. I bought a Pepsi, a medium popcorn, and a box of Mike & Ikes. After we got our concessions, we went to the movie auditorium. The movie was just about to start as we got to our seats. For the next two hours, we paid close attention to the movie and enjoyed our snacks. After the movie ended and the credits began to roll, we exited the auditorium and the theater.",

So I went to a different site and did the same thing.  I finally found a dress that I liked. So, I signed in and payed for the dress. It said it would arrive at my home in a couple of days.

We started by picking up all of the toys off of the floor and putting them in his toy box. There were several puzzles and games that were open on the floor and scattered throughout the room. We put these back together and and put them away in the game closet. He picked up his books and put them back on the bookshelf. I helped him put his crayons back in their box and put away his other art supplies that were on his desk. We both made his bed together. He put all of his dirty laundry away in the hamper or folded up the clothes that were clean and put them in the dresser. Once the floor was cleared, I vacuumed the carpet. He also helped by dusting all of his shelves.",

I didn't hear it at first as I was doing dishes, because I keep the cordless phone in my bedroom on my nightstand. I finally heard it after the third or fourth ring I'd say, and ran into my room to answer it. I wasn't surprised to hear the voice on the other end was a female telemarketer. She was asking me if I wanted to sign up for a credit card. I politely declined, and asked her to please take my name off of her calling list. She agreed to do so, but told me it can take up to 30 days to stop receiving the calls. I told her thank you and hung up the phone. I returned the phone to the charging dock and walked back into the kitchen to finish washing the dishes.",

I tested the formula on my skin to make sure it was the right temperature, and took the bottle out of the water when the formula was ready. I held my baby as I fed her the bottle, making sure she was comfortable and could drink well. After she had drunk all the formula, I put the bottle in the sink to clean later and then burped my infant.

I realized she was right-- the weeds were growing pretty tall, and I hadn't cut the grass in weeks. I decided it was time to mow the lawn the next day. I went to the garage to find my lawnmower. I rolled the lawnmower over to the lawn, and then turned the lawnmower on. It started roaring, signaling that it was on and ready to cut grass. I mowed the grass in neat rows, starting on one side of my lawn and mowing all the way to the other side. I made sure not to miss any patches by going back and forth with the mowing machine. After I inspected my work, I decided I was happy with it. The grass looked much neater. I turned off the lawnmower and returned it to the garage.",

I knew it would be a waste of precious time to go home and change so I brought a change of clothes with me to the office. I freshened up and changed in the office bathroom. I am so lucky they have a actual shower in here. So me and my friends had already decided which pub we'd hit this week, it was \"The Hive\". It was named so because it was always \"buzzing\" with people . Stupid or clever? I don't know. So the four of us , Clay , Justin , Tony and myself had to reach the pub by 8:00. I pulled up my phone to book a cab. First I opened \"ola\" the app took a lot of time to load probably because the internet speed was slow. After a minute the app finally opened and show no cabs around. Then I opened \"Uber\" it loaded almost instantly and there were cabs available near me but due to high demand it had surge pricing(more than usual rate). I had no option but to take the Uber at a high price, since we rarely get time to hangout.",

His boss was very upset that Jeff did not show up for work on time that day. so Jeff was told to return to his post and get to work or he will be fired. When Jeff got home from work, he went to the store to pick up some alarm clock batteries. The lady at the store said that they didn't sell batteries and that Jeff should try another store that was close to them. He got back in his car and drove to the other store. He got the batteries and went home. Jeff walked into his room and opened up the alarm clock, he took the old batteries out and replaced them with the new ones. Lastly he closed up the alarm clock and set it for the correct time that he had to wake up for work the next morning.",

While I'm waiting to see the doctor, the nurse may weigh me, take my temperature and blood pressure, and ask some general questions about my health. When the doctor comes in, he or she asks me how I am and why I scheduled an appointment. If I need to undress, the doctor leaves the room while I do. During the examination, the doctor may check my vision, hearing, reflexes, breathing rate and heart rate. Depending on the reason for my visit, the doctor may perform other, more specific procedures to diagnose and treat diseases, injuries and other conditions. The diagnosis and treatment are noted in my chart. He or she may also prescribe medication and other treatments. At the end of the visit, I redress.

First, I get the eggs out and begin cracking them on the side of the bowl and dumping them into the bowl. I normally use two eggs whites and one whole egg to cut the calories. I begin beating the eggs with a fork or a whisk. I add some salt and pepper to the mix for flavor. I pour the mixture into the hot frying pan. I make sure that I add some vegetable oil to the pan before I add the eggs though because I don't want them to stick. I let the pan sit for a bit so the egg mixture heats up a bit on one side. As this occurs, I add some cheese or vegetable to the center of the egg mixture. Really, almost any type of cheese or vegetable makes a good omelette. I then flip one side of the omelette over on to itself to seal in the contents in the middle. I then flip the omelette over several more times to lightly brown it on both sides. It is then ready to serve!",

It was heavy to lift over the weather so I needed help from my dad to lift it. Although this was difficult, I was able to lift it and bring it to the yard. Once I got to the yard, I started to turn it on and mow the lawn. I went up and down each row of grass slowly. I noticed everything getting cut and I continued to mow the lawn. Upon finishing, I took the lawn mower back inside and lifted it back over the washer and dryer and into the garage. Overall, I felt that this process was smooth and easy, but yet still time consuming. The whole process took almost an hour for a small yard then.",

We invited most of our neighbors and most of them graciously accepted. Some of them declined as they were busy during the planned time of the barbecue. We decided to make the food of choice burgers and hot dogs. Most of the people at he barbecue were pleased with the food choice. My kids were fairly entertained as a lot of people in my neighborhood have kids as well, so they had plenty of friends to play with at the party. We also told everyone to bring swimming gear as well as we had just recently opened up our pool. I'm sure the most of the kids enjoyed that. Everyone said that the food tasted amazing and that really pleased me. Everyone had an enjoyable time as the barbecue went on into the night.",

When I was ready to cook lunch, I took my indoor grill out from the cabinet, plugged it in, and waited for it to heat up. While I waited for the grill to heat up, I set my plate with a bun, a handful of chips, and 2 pickles. Once the grill was ready I placed the hot dog on the grill and closed the lid. When the hot dog was halfway done cooking, I opened the lid and turned the hot dog around, so all sides would be equally browned. After the hot dog had finished cooking, I removed it from the grill and put it on my bun. Before eating my hot dog, I unplugged my grill, and wiped it down with a wet cloth. After I finished that, I was ready to eat my hot dog. I squeezed a small amount of ketchup on top of my hot dog and took my plate to the porch to eat. I enjoyed eating my hot dog, chips, and pickles. W I was finished eating, I brought my empty plate inside and rinsed it off.",

I will also need a scrubber to clean the sink and the bathtub. The last thing I will need is a special soap also called a cleaning product. Cleaning the bathroom can be a really dirty job. First I'll put on some big rubber cleaning gloves. These special rubber gloves will keep my hands from getting dirty. First I will clean the sink out with water and soap. Next I will scrub all of the dirt away with the scrubber, water, and the soap. Then I will use a special toilet bowl brush to clean the toilet. Next I will sweep the floor with the broom. Lastly I will mop the floor. Now the bathroom is sparkling clean again.",

Once there, I went to my airlines check in desk and waited on line to check my suitcase.  There were lots of different people on the line, from business men and women like me, to families, even a high school band.  When I finally reached the desk, a representative for the airline was there to help me.  She was very cheerful and helpful, and I was able to put my suitcase up on the conveyor belt and watch it join other suitcases on their way to the airplanes.  I was even able to switch my seats because there were available seats still left on the plane.  Once I was all confirmed, she printed out my boarding pass and I was able to continue on to security and then onto my plane.",

I plugged in the cord into a wall socket. I then turned on a switch on the side of the vacuum and the vacuum turned on, making a loud noise! Using my arms, I moved the vacuum back and forth across the dirty carpet. I made sure to clean every single area on my carpet. Once I was satisfied with how clean my carpet was, I turned off my vacuum. I unplugged the cord and wrapped it back around my vacuum. I wheeled it back to my cleaning closet and put it away in it's rightful place.",

I drove to a store that sells different types of cards, including packages of invitations. There, I found some festive-looking cards that would be ideal for this purpose. I chose three packages holding 10 invitations each. I paid for them at a cashier's counter. After driving home, I filled out each invitation in ink with the necessary information and signed my name. Then I wrote out the envelopes by hand with each person's name and address. I had to use my address book to find the information or else I needed to look it up online if I didn't have the details. When this task was complete, I placed a postage stamp in the upper-right corner of each envelope, then licked the adhesive on each envelope before pressing the flap down to seal it. The final step was to bring all the envelopes to the post office the next day and place them in the box for outgoing mail.",

We picked up the tambourine and put them in a box that we normally keep it in.  I grabbed her xylophone and put it up in a closet where it belongs.  We got a box where we keep her LEGO's and put all of the little pieces in there.  After all the pieces were picked up, we needed to put the containers away.  One of the boxes was put on the shelf.  Another box was put underneath my daughter's bed.  After we had put all of the toys away, we needed to make sure they were all picked up.  We looked around the room and couldn't find anything else that needed to go back into a container where it can be put away.",

Once I had them all, I started to to make preliminary preparation, so at lat moment I will not have to rush. I marinated some meat, that I was going to bake. Some of the stuff, which I needed to fry, I made and freeze them. I made dessert 2 days  in advance, so I was done with it. Last thing I had to do is, made all accessories ready  like spoons and plates and drinks and dishes. Time arrived and everything was ready.",

First I put a coat of primer on the wall so the paper will apply nice and smooth. Then I have to cut and measure the paper. I have a special machine that lets me roll the paper out to the length I need and then cuts it in straight lines. Then I have to put glue on the paper. I apply it to the back of the paper then stick it on the wall as evenly as I can. I use a paint knife to smooth out any bubbles in the paper. Then I wipe off any excess glue with a wet sponge. Now it's time for the next piece. I repeat the process and make sure the pattern lines up. I repeat until all done.",

I picked her up one of those Saturdays and took her to the club.  There was a fee we had to pay to dance of about 10 dollars.  After we got in, the music started to get really loud and we got really excited.  We jumped out into the dance floor and started to dance with each other.  We would stomp our feet and clap our hands.  We would twirl around and jump around.  It was a lot of fun for us and we got really thirsty.  We went to the side of the floor and got a drink that was over there.  She said she had a lot of fun but was tired, so I went and dropped her off at her house.",

He had a few kebabs and I had an Indian and Asian fusion salad. After finishing dinner, we went to a movie. We saw a special showing of older movies on modern screens. We saw \"Jaws,\" and it was very interesting to see a movie that came out before we were both born on the big screen. We both jumped when the Jaws jumped out of the water as we nibbled on our Goobers and Sour Patch Kids. When the movie was over, we drove to a local park and just talked as we stared up at the stars. It was the perfect ending to such a romantic night.",

The machine turned the dirt around and made sure that it was fresh to be planted.  We took out seeds and spaced them apart to give room for the plants to grow.  We watered them every day after that and made sure that they didn't get run over by weeds or bugs.  When the fall came around, my whole family went outside to pick the plants.  We picked out the corn and peas and beans.  My dad and I cut the melons off of the vine and we ate those while we finished all of our work out there.",

They are easy to use and make a very nice cake . it really does n't take much time . All you need to do is get one bowl . Add the cake mix from the box . Either 2 or 3 eggs added to the bowl . Then a half cup of oil and finally about a cup of water . Then you need to get your mixer and put it on medium and mix it all up for 2 to 3 minutes . Then put it into a non stick cake pan and bake for about 30 minutes . So all together about 10 minutes preparation and 30 minutes baking you can have a good tasting cake in 40 minutes . . I do n't really like frosting so as soon as it cools I cut myself a slice .",

WE started with lazy river, and then with small slides. and then in wave pool, big slides and rides in boat slide which was falling from above, and splashing water all around. There were couple of water slides , which were kind of risky. If someone is not careful, they can get hurt. But over all, it was good. Best part that food was included in ticket. We went to  slide which one was above the water and falling in to 12 feet water. Kind of scary but we did it. It was literally hitting our body.",

I would unroll a portion of the wrapping paper on a large, flat surface, like a table or the floor. I would put the gift in a box to make it easier to wrap, especially if the gift is an unusually shaped object. I would wrap the end of the wrapping paper around the gift so that there is a little extra room at both ends. I would use the scissors to cut the wrapping paper from the rest of the roll. Then I would fold the wrapping paper over the boxed gift until the two ends of the paper meet. I would use a piece of tape to keep the wrapping paper in place. I would then fold the ends of the wrapping paper toward each other so that the whole box is covered. I would use several pieces of tape on each side to make sure the paper stays attached to the box.",

My alarm clock had died! I quickly called my boss and explained why I would be late, and made sure to make a note in my phone to stop at the store later to pick up some replacement batteries. On my way home from work, I pulled into the hardware store to pick up some batteries. However, I realized that in my rush that morning I forgot to look at what kind of batteries I needed! I took a gamble and went with a pack of AAA batteries. I was anxious when I drove home because I didn't want to have to go back to the store. When I got home, I realized that I had gotten the right batteries! I quickly changed the batteries in my alarm clock and tested it to make sure that it worked. It did, and I made sure to always change my batteries every three months so I would never be late for work again.",

I took off what I was wearing and stepped in to the shower. I turned on the water and let it run for a few seconds to get warm. I adjusted the water temperature until it was how I wanted it. I like to use warm water but not hot as hot water can dry out your hair and skin. I put my head under the shower head and thoroughly wet my hair. I opened the shampoo bottle, poured a quarter-sized puddle of shampoo in my hand. I rubbed my hands together for a second to spread the shampoo over them and then rubbed the shampoo in to my hair. I rubbed the shampoo around in my hair to make sure it got everywhere. I put my head back under the shower head to wash out the shampoo. I rinsed my hair until there was no more shampoo. I turned off the shower, used a towel to dry my hair and skin and got dressed.",

I told her how my friends and I planned a trip to Washington D.C. for vacation.  I signed the letter and folded it up.  I carefully placed the letter into the envelope and addressed it to my grandma.  I put a stamp on the letter and I walked down to the post office.  I gave my letter to the postman and he put it in the mail to go out the next day.  I bet Grandma will be excited to get my letter!",

Soup always makes me feel better in these situations.  I always find Tom Kha to be especially good as a cold remedy.  I had already been to the grocery store and gotten all the ingredients I needed.  I chopped up some lemongrass and ginger and started cooking them in some chicken broth with lime leaves.  While this was simmering, I chopped up some chicken, and placed that in the pot as well.  Then I added the coconut milk, fish sauce, and mushrooms.  I let it simmer for a while to let all the tastes blend. I occasionally tasted the soup, and added extra seasonings until it tasted just right.  The Tom Kha made a very tasty dinner.  I'm looking forward to having the leftovers for lunch tomorrow.",

I blocked my dogs from getting in, turned on the ventilation fan and pulled tucked the shower curtain behind the toilet tank to get it out of the way. I sprayed everything with foaming shower cleaner so there was a thick layer of foam coating the walls, the sides of the tub and the bottom of the tub. I let it sit for a few minutes to soak in and then I used a sponge with a scrubber on it to scrub all parts of the shower, some areas have a lot of hard water stains so I had to scrub even harder. After I have scrubbed everything clean I stood on the side of the tub and turned the shower on cold water, I moved the shower head around to rinse the walls. I aimed the water stream to push all of the foamy water down the drain. When I was done rinsing I left the ventilation fan on and closed the bathroom door so it could dry.",

I then opened the wrapping paper, and pulled out enough paper to cover the entire gift. I used a pair of scissors to cut the paper at that length. I then put the paper on the floor, and placed the gift in the center of the paper. I then began to cover the gift with the paper, by folding each side of the paper until it was over the gift, then I would take another side and do the same, until all sides were covering the gift. I then used tape to keep all the folds neatly together. Marc's Gift was now wrapped.",

I decided to get on my computer and look up flights from Birmingham to Portland.  I got online and searched cheap plane tickets in my web browser.  Several websites popped up, and I chose Travelocity.com website to search.  I clicked on the link that said, \"Today's Flight Deal\" .  I chose the option of taking a round trip flight, then I filled out that I would like to leave from the Birmingham Airport and arrive at the Portland Airport.  I selected that there would be one adult on this trip.   I have the third week of June off of work, so I decided to leave on that Monday morning. I searched to see what flights were available, and picked the one with the earliest leave time.  Then I was asked when I would like to return to Birmingham, and I chose a flight that would return me back home.  Once that was selected, I was told I could continue with my booking and add my personal information like name, phone number, and credit card information.  It was very easy, and I'm excited to be going to see my grandma soon!",

My appointment was set for two weeks ahead of time for a follow up. I got to the office ten minutes early in case I had to fill out any paperwork. I entered the lobby and approached the front desk. The desk nurse greeted me and had me sign in with my name and doctor I was there to see. She told me I could sit down to wait so I found a chair near the front to sit. I didn't have to wait long and was called to the back by the head nurse. The nurse first took my weight, then my temperature and blood pressure readings. She said everything was fine. Next, she had me follow her to the room where the doctor would see me. Once there she had me sit on the bed and asked me how I was and if I had any symptoms. After taking a blood sample she left the room. I waited for 10 minutes and Dr. Jane came in. After a short discussion, she said the antibiotics had done their job and that my vertigo was all cleared up. After thanking the doctor I paid my fee and was even given a sucker with my receipt which made me smile. Finally, I left the office. I felt good about my appointment and felt relieved that I was no longer ill.",

There was only one important chore for me to get done before I could up my friend and see if her and her companion wanted to come along - laundry.  I made sure to just do the bare necessities for the coming week so I didn't waste much time then came the decision of whether or not to fold it immediately or wait until later.  I figured with such a small load, I could get away with folding it and putting it away rather quickly, and that's what I did.  Folding my clothes left me with one less thing to worry about and we were all able to be nice and relaxed on such a beautiful day.",

I decided it was time to clean the shower before things got worse. I went to my cleaning supply cabinet and took out some cleaning spray, paper towels, and a scrubber. Before I removed any grime from the shower, I took out all of my shampoo, conditioner, and other items from the shower. Whatever was empty or I never used, I tossed out. From there I sprayed down the shower with the cleaning chemicals and let it sit for a while. After that I got in there with the scrubber and scrubbed until there was nothing left on the tiles. On the more delicate things, I used the paper towels to wipe down. Once all was clean, I used the removable shower head to rinse down the shower walls and tub. Once clean, I returned the remaining shampoo bottles, etc. and put away my cleaning supplies.",

I get his leash and head to the door, and he's already waiting for me because he saw me getting the leash.  I put the leash on his collar, open the door, and we're off!  We walk down the block, stopping every so often so he can sniff around and see all his favorite sights, then start to head home.  On the way home, sometimes we see one of my neighbors who is also walking their dog--I'll stop and talk with him for a few minutes while our dogs say hello and play around for a few minutes.  After that, we'll go back to my yard, and he'll potty before going back into the house.  I'll close the door behind us, then take the leash off his collar before he goes running back into the house, looking for some other fun thing for us to do.",

It took a while for him to write, but he told all about the summer, what he did over school break, what he has to do next semester in school, and how many years he has to go to school to be a doctor.  He told his cousin that he wanted to come visit as soon as possible, so they could go fishing, and swimming again that cool lake in the mountains.  He was tired of studying, and working all the time.   After he finished writing the letter, he folded it up, and put a stamp on the letter. He addressed it and put it in the mailbox for the post man to come get it. He knew he would hear soon from his cousin, and that made him happy.",

The linens are picked up for the laundry. There are two flat sheets. The first flat sheet is spread across the bed and tucked tightly using a special fold so it won't undo itself. The send flat sheet is spread out, then the blanket.  Folding the top edge over the blanket, both are tuck between the mattress and spring board. Pillows  are put into clean pillow sacks and the top cover is laid over and tucked under the pillows. Some motels put a mint chocolate on the pillow but most don't. A real fancy hotel would have a flat sheet on top of the blanket as well as below it because that isn't washed everyday. Hotel beds can harbor bed bugs and fleas in the mattress itself.",

We went to the room the wedding was taking place in and found a seat to wait for the ceremony to begin. After a few minutes everyone was at their seats, the groom and the wedding party was at the alter, and it was time to begin. It was finally time for my sister to walk down the aisle. In front of my sister was a flower girl walking down the aisle and tossing flowers on the floor. When she made it to the front the music started and everyone stood up to see the beautiful bride. She walked down the aisle with her dad so he could give her away. Her and her now husband said their I do's and the ceremony was over.",

However, the apartment was very dirty so I needed to clean it up quickly before my parents got there. I started with the kitchen. I put all of the dishes in the dishwasher and ran it. Then, I wiped off all of the counter tops and made sure that everything on the counters was neatly arranged.  I then moved onto the bathroom. I quickly scrubbed out the toilet and the bathtub, and wiped down the bathroom counter. I also made sure to clean the mirror. I moved onto my bedroom. I picked up all of my clothes off of the floor, rearranged the items on my dresser, and made my bed. Finally, I went to clean the living room. I quickly vacuumed the living room floor and straightened up the pillows on my couch. I did one final look around my apartment and was satisfied that it was clean.",

I arrived at the airport ninety minutes before my flight was scheduled to leave to insure I had sufficient time to check in, pass through security and make it to the flight gate.  I had confirmed my reservation ahead of time and printed out a boarding pass which I took with me to the airport.  When I arrived I had luggage to check.  Since I arrived in with enough time I checked my bags at the check in counter.  There was a much shorter line for people who already had their boarding pass.  They gave me receipts which I would need to claim my luggage at my destination.  I put the receipts in my wallet so I would not loose them.  Next there was a line for the security screening.  I patiently waited in the line with the other passengers.  It took 30 minutes to get through the line.  At the screening check point they verified I was not carrying any dangerous items.  I was now able to to to the gate where my plane would depart from.  I had 20 minutes to relax before my flight left.",

First, we took pictures of it and spent some time looking at the pictures, deciding what we wanted to keep and what things we wanted to change about the room.  We then made a list of things we needed to buy at the store to accomplish this renovation.  We went to the store with our list and bought the items we needed.  We came back home and began working in the basement.  We worked together and removed certain things first.  Then, we painted the basement walls together.  After that, we waited until the paint dried.  Then, we hung pictures on the walls that we'd bought.  We then placed a few items like a couch and large TV that we'd bought in the basement.  We added our new carpets too.  Finally, we put the popcorn machine in the corner of the basement and our basement looked new and fresh!  We were excited but tired so we both plopped ourselves on the new couch and napped together happily.  Our basement had been nicely renovated indeed!",

I went to the kitchen and took my electric water kettle to the sink and filled it up with enough water to make a couple of large cups of tea. I then put the kettle back down on its base and pressed the start button so it would begin to heat the water up. In the meantime, I found my favorite mug in the cabinet where we keep the mugs. It was in the very front. I like it because it is big and it has cartoon pictures of owls on it that are cute. I took the mug over to the counter where the kettle was a put it down. I then opened up a box of Earl Grey Tea and pulled out a tea bag and placed it in my mug. The kettle then let me know the water was ready by beeping loudly. I poured the water until the mug was about two-thirds full.  I then set a timer for four minutes to give the tea enough time to steep. I like to set a timer because I sometimes forget and end up with cold tea! When the timer went off, I pulled out the teabag with a spoon and placed it in the trashcan. Then I put a packet of sweetener into the tea. I then took the almond milk out of the refrigerator and put enough of the milk into the tea until it turned a lighter color. I put the milk away and got a spoon. I stirred the  tea to make sure it was all mixed well. Then, because I was being impatient, I got two ice cubes and placed them in the mug of tea to cool it off some. I stirred the tea until they melted and then put the spoon in the sink. I turned off the kettle and left the kitchen with my mug of tea. I sat down at my computer and began to drink it happily. It came out perfectly.",

We knew that Madrid had a very good and easy subway system, but none of us had ever taken it before so we were a little bit nervous. We got off the bus and quickly found a subway map so we could get to our hotel. After looking at the map for awhile, we decided we needed to take two different trains to get to where we needed to go. We got on our first train and everything went smoothly. However, after we got on our second train, we quickly realized we were headed in the wrong direction! We got off  at the next stop and switched to the other side of the subway station so we could get to our hotel. We finally made it to our hotel and laughed about taking the wrong train by accident.",

I brought my two suitcases filled with clothes and necessities , along with my visa and other important travel documents . Once I got to the airport , I passed by security and they checked my bags for anything that was illegal or dangerous . Once I got past the checkpoint , I waited at a terminal for an hour . They began to call for my plane and I got on line . I gave the lady my visa and ticket and I boarded the airplane . I put the luggage above my head in the luggage department and sat down . My seat was next to a window so I was very happy about that . Soon a person sat down next to me . We were told to eventually put our seat belts on as we were ready to fly . We watched a short video on what to do in case we felt some turbulence and what to do in case of emergency . Then the airplane lifted off and I was scared at first , I felt some shaking but eventually we were in the air and everything was okay . Eventually they began to serve food . That was my favorite part . I love airplane food !",

Maybe I should start with some small talk. OK that's what I'll do: Hello, Nice weather we're having today huh? I'm not a fan myself but what do you think? I didn't know how to contact you whether in person or what so I just decided to go old school and write you a letter. The truth is that I've always loved you.

He and I walked around the house with the painting and looked for the perfect spot. We looked in the living room, the kitchen, the playroom, and even the bathroom. We finally decided it would look best in my bedroom. That way I could always see it and it would be with me. We took the painting, a nail, a hammer and a tape measure and headed into my room to hang it up. We measured the wall and chose a good spot to hang it. I put the nail in a little and let my little boy hammer it is, too. We hung the painting on the nail and it was the perfect touch that my room needed.",

Soon after I packed my clothes, I started to pack other items such as deodorant, toothpaste, cologne, etc. This was easy, but as my suitcase  started to fill up, I felt like I had to start making room for everything. As a result, I made room for everything by using all of the compartments of the bag and taking out some clothes that I didn't need. This was a difficult process because I wanted to make sure that I packed enough for the vacation, but not too much to the point where I wouldn't be able to carry it around.",

We told the taxi cab driver where we wanted to go. There was a lot of traffic so it took a long while to get back to our hotel. Once we were at our hotel the taxi driver let us know what our total for the ride was. It came out to $15.00. My husband decided he would pay for it since some friends paid for our last round of drinks. We paid the taxi driver and all exited the taxi. We were very glad we found a taxi to take us home instead of walking the whole way. It was a very easy decision to make since we were all tired and it is a very big city!",

Then there were the dolls.  The kids have a special hamper where they put all their dolls.  I threw the dolls into the hamper.  The dolls accessories were next.  They belonged in a plastic container near the doll hamper.  The room was almost clean.  All that was left were the toy cars.  I picked them up and tossed them into a bin that we keep under the bed.  When all the cars were gone, I rolled the bin back under the bed.  The next time it was dirty, they would have to clean it themselves!",

This means you tell the restaurant when you are coming to eat, and they agree to have a table ready for you. Some restaurants let you make your reservation online, but for others you have to call and speak to a host or hostess. This Saturday, my family wants to eat at our favorite Greek restaurant. This place doesn't have online reservations, so on Wednesday afternoon I called and spoke to Maria, the hostess. I asked Maria if my family of four could make a reservation for 6pm on Saturday, but that time wasn't available. Maria told me we could eat at 4:30 or 7:30 instead. 4:30 is too early for our dinner, so I picked the 7:30 reservation.",

I used a cotton ball that had been slightly soaked in rubbing alcohol to clean the reflective surface of the DVD, wiping side to side and up and down instead of in a circular pattern in order to avoid deepening any pre-existing scratches. Once I have removed all of the fingerprints and smudges, I used a dry paper tile to remove the excess alcohol and any strands that may have come off the cotton ball. Now that the DVD is ready to be played, I push the power button on the DVD player. I push the open button to release the cartridge that holds the DVD disc inside of the player. When the cartridge was ejected, I saw that there was a DVD that had already been inside the player, so I removed the DVD from the player, and placed it to the side. The DVD containing the movie that I wished to watch was in my hand, and I placed it into the same cartridge I had just removed the other DVD from. I then pushed the open button on the player again, and the cartridge automatically retracted back into the player with the DVD. As I heard the DVD player spinning the disc, I picked up the remote control to get ready to push play once the video had finished loading.",

My table is really dirty and made of stone so I find a good cleaning spray to use on it. The spray I chose is good for stone and doesn't hurt it, and it also gets rid of the stickiness and dirt on the table. I spray the table with not too much of the chemical, and then use some paper towels to rub the table. I make sure I rub the whole table and rub off any dirt or stickiness. After the whole table is rubbed off, I make sure there are no chemicals left on the table and that it is dry. My table is nice and clean again.",

I scheduled an appointment with her over the phone to see her as soon as possible. Thankfully she would be able to see the next day. I went to the clinic the next day and told the receptionist  about my appointment. After a few minutes of waiting, my doctor saw me in her office. After a few different tests, she was finally able to give me a proper diagnosis. She told me that I had come down with bronchitis, and gave me a prescription for some medicine. I took this prescription to the pharmacy next door, and after an hour was able to get my medicine. I took this medicine for about 2 weeks, and before I knew it, I felt much better.",

Going straight to the kitchen, she grabbed everything she would need to deep clean the shower. A bucket, a sponge, shower cleaner, a baggie for trash, a scrubbing pad, and a large bucket. Going in, she started by running the shower on very hot to wet down the whole shower area. Being careful not to burn herself, she waved the shower head back and forth to get all the corners wet. Then, she sprayed the shower cleaner all over the shower and organized her counter while she waited a few minutes to let it soak in. Using the sponge, she scrubbed and scrubbed to get all the build up off. She then turned the shower back on and rinsed all the tile and the fixtures, using the sponge now and again to spread the water around. She put all the debris in the baggie, and threw it away in the kitchen. Standing back, she gave herself a tiny pat on the back for the gleaming bathroom shower she was leaving behind.",

It took a while to find parking . Once we boarded the train , we took a seat . The train conductor came by and we purchased 2 round trip tickets with cash . The ride to the city took about an hour . Many people got on and off at every stop . I enjoyed the people watching . There were many different types of people , the business types , students , families , and coeds . There were a couple loud babies and annoying blondes as well . It was very loud . After about an hour , we were almost to our stop . Once we arrived , the train pulled into the system and the conductor announced that it was the last stop and that everything had to depart . We walked onto the platform and into the train station , then were on our way .",

First, we cleared a patch of grass and built a large circle made of big rocks. Next we put some logs around the circle of rocks for us to sit on. Then we went into the woods to gather some dry tree branches and dry leaves. We then put them inside the circle of rocks and made a large pile. We lit a match and put it into the large pile, so the branches and leaves caught fire. It made huge flames, which were nice and hot to sit by. We then sat around the bonfire, told stories, sang songs, and roasted some marshmallows. In a few hours, the fire began to die out, but it allowed us to have a good night. After the bonfire was out, we left and went to bed.",

I give him a toy and secure it to the cart after I wipe it down to make sure its clean , and we enter the store . We go through the store and using my list grab what I need . Since i usually go two or more times a week , I only spend about 3 minutes there before I have all we need and can pay . Then we go back out to the car . I put my son back in his car seat and the bagged groceries in the trunk and head home .",

I invited our families and her friends over two weeks ago to give them plenty of time to arrange to come.  I ordered a birthday cake in the number of 13, representing his new age. I purchased gifts which she had hinted to wanting and a few extra's also. I also purchased decorations, paper plates and cups and party favors. I sent her to spend the night with her best friend, whose mother knew what was going on and while she was with her friend I prepared the house for her party.  My daughter was expected to be home at 2;00 the next day and I went to work on placing everything where it needed to go.  All of our families and her friends started gathering to the house about 1:30.  When she arrived home we were all in the living room, surrounding her cake and presents.  The party began and my daughter was very happy with what transpired.",

We were in this never ending flux of wall colors. Her most ambitious project was painting her bedroom in an unconventional way. Instead of using a roller and painting the walls a solid color, she would dab a rag in the pan of paint and repeatedly press it against the wall, creating a unique textured look. The problem was, her bedroom was huge, so this took months and enlisted the help of me and my siblings. The first time I tried it, I did all of the dabs in a really uniform way, so each looked like the other. This was not how she had painted the rest of the wall, and so my section stood out and looked very different from the rest. She didn't paint over it or anything, so for the remainder of the time that we spent in that house, that section of wall looked completely wrong and out of place.",

We then walked into the main room of the museum. We wandered around for a while, taking the stairs to different floors and walking into all of the different rooms. We saw paintings in some rooms, sculptures in others, and some rooms had special exhibitions going on. When we became tired, we stopped at the cafe to enjoy a cup of coffee and a snack. After resting at the cafe, we looked at a few more exhibits and watched a video about the museum in a screening room. After this we were ready to leave, so we walked out to the car and drove home.",

I carefully steer the car to the back of the building.  I take my foot off of the gas pedal and use it to press down on the brake pedal.

I was in luck however , as my friend had a bicycle repair kit and some spare tires . Once we arrived at my friend 's house , I asked my friend if he let me borrow his bicycle repair kit . First , I turned the bike over and removed the front tire and tube . Next I filled the tube with air to check where the tube was damaged , and found a small glass shard which had punctured through it . After making ensure the tube was fully deflated , I repaired the puncture in the tube by using glue and applying a patch on top , then slid it back onto the tire using my hands . Next , I placed and pushed the tire back onto the tube . After which , I reconnected the tire onto the bicycle . Finally , I pumped air into the tire until it was filled up and the bicycle was ready to be ridden again .",

I check the sky for rainy clouds to make sure it will not rain soon, and also check the Internet for any rain later today. It will not rain today, so it is safe to mow the lawn on my lawnmower. My lawnmower has a motor and a seat for me to ride in, so it is much easier to use. I go into my garage to make sure my lawnmower has enough gas to work. The lawnmower has plenty of gas and is in good shape, so I turn the key and start its engine. The lawnmower doesn't cut the grass unless you pull the lever that controls the blade, so I pull that lever and start to drive the lawnmower over the grass. I make sure the grass is being cut after I drive over it, and carefully steer the lawnmower over all the tall grass in my yard until the grass is cut.",

On the invite, I include information such as when and where the party is. I also include what type of attire people should wear so that people are dressed appropriately for the party. These day, it is much easier to send party invitations through electronic means on the computer such social media or email. It also saves money on stamps, and I do not have to write out the addresses on the envelopes by hand.

I got behind the wheel made sure I checked the mirrors so I could see everything around me. I put my seat belt on and told the instructor to put theirs on too. I adjusted my seat so I could reach the pedals and steering wheel comfortably. It was time to put the key in the ignition and start the car. After the car was on I checked the mirrors to make sure I would not hit anything and backed out the parking spot. He instructed me to drive the car around the block to make sure I knew the basics of driving. After he felt comfortable we went out onto the road. We drove for a few miles before going back to the school.",

Shortly the barber said I'm all finish. I said thanks you. I went outside get into my car. I felt something wet as I lean back, it was my shirt soaked in the back. I was so upset and disappointed. I rushed back home to change shirt, by the time we made it, my reservation was taken. My afternoon was ruined due to a simple hair wash.",

I went to the hardware store and found a color of paint that I liked.  I asked a friend to help me move all of the furniture away from the walls and take down all the pictures.  We put down tarps on the floor so that paint did not get everywhere.  I put down painter's tape along the molding so that they did not get painted.  It was a lot of work but we got the room painted in a few days.  Once the walls were dry, I painted the molding along the floor with fresh white paint.  I got inspired after the painting and set up a new set of wooden shelves, painted the same white as the molding.  Then we moved the furniture back around until the room looked nice and fresh.",

We got a key to open the door and we opened it up.  There was a tray that had hot coals on it and we poured water on it to get the room really steamy.  We sat in there in our swimming suits and relaxed in the heat.  After we were done, we turned the coal burner down and left.",

The first time we did was move everything out of the room.  Next, we went to the store and picked out paint.  We painted the walls a beautiful blue and then we had to pick out new flooring.  We decided on hardwood floors.  We ordered the wood, but had to hire a contractor to put the flooring in since we couldn't do it ourselves.  The contractor came in and had the job done within a day.  Once that was done, we put up new curtains and brought in new home d\u00e9cor.  We put the furniture back into the living room and added different personalized touches like pictures to make the room just right.  It was a lot of work, but totally worth it!",

                "text": "It was summertime and I was very thirsty. I wanted to drink orange juice very badly, but I did not have any orange juice. Luckily I had an orange tree in my backyard. I picked some good and ripe oranges to juice. In the kitchen, I brought out my electric juicing machine and plugged it in. I washed the outside of each orange to make sure my juice did not get dirty. Then, I cut each orange in half and turned the juicer on. This kind of juicer worked by spinning a plastic piece inside the juicy part of the orange when you held the orange against it. The juicer squished all the orange bits inside the peel and turned it into juice. The juice came out the side of the juicer from a spout and poured into a glass that I had put there before. The juicer was very good at its job, and removed all the seeds from the juice that came out for me. The orange juice was fresh and tasty.",

After all the cookie baking mess was cleaned up, I took the vacuum cleaner, plugged it in to an outlet and vacuumed the floor being careful to get under the edges of where the counter stuck out.  I made sure I sucked up all the crumbs and other dirt before I unplugged the vacuum and put it away.  Next, I found the mop and mop bucket and carried them to the kitchen sink.  I let the water run until it was nice and hot, measured half a cup Lysol floor cleaner into the bucket, then filled it half way with hot water.  I placed the bucket on the floor, dipped the mop in to get it soaking wet, lifted it out of the water and kept it over the bucket, pulled down on the handle to wring out the extra water.  I started mopping the floor, rinsing the mop in the bucket every few minutes until I had reached the doorway.  I rinsed the mop once more, wrung it out and stood it on the kitchen floor propped up against the wall while I took the bucket out to our gravel driveway to empty it.  After I rinsed the bucket, I put it and the mop away.  The floor looked much better.  Time to eat some cookies!",

I pulled out my cutting board and a knife and diced up the onion and peppers. Once they were diced, I got a pan out and put it on the stove top and turned on the stove. While it heated up, I cracked three eggs into a bowl. I stirred the eggs thoroughly. When the pan was heated, I put the peppers and eggs into the pan. I let them simmer for about three minutes before mixing the eggs in. I turned the heat down and let it cook. When it was about half done, I flipped half of it onto itself. I covered the top and let it sit until it was done. I turned off the stove top and put the omelette on a plate. It was delicious!",

I pulled out clothes and put them in the laundry basket and carried them to my room. I turned on the television so I would have something to watch while folding. I first folded all of my shirts and put them in one pile. After that I folded all of my pants and put them in another pile. I then matched and rolled all of my socks just the way I like them. I then repeated this process with my husband's clothes. When I was finished folding the clothes I put them all away where they belonged.",

First I removed the plastic bag from the garbage canister so that it would slide out of its. But before removing the bag, I pulled on the yellow drawstrings that was once holding the trashbag over the canister securely, but now will be used to close the garbage bag. From the two holes that I could see the yellow ribbon, I pulled at the yellow plastic which drew the top of the garbage bag closed once I was satisfied with the tightness, I tied the two yellow stripes into a not to secure the closure in place. Using the dotted yellow plastic straps, I pulled the bag of words while using the other hand to pool the canister downwards. This separated the canister from the garbage bag, and I took the full and close garbage bag out the door and put it in the trashcan. I came back into the house, reached under the cabinet and grabbed a brand-new, empty trashbag. I unfolded it completely, and placed the bottom of the garbage bag into the bottom of the trash canister. I opened the yellow handle that is woven into the top rim of the garbage bag, using the yellow to guide me as I fitted the bag around the rim of the canister. Now the new trashbag was inside and ready to be used.",

As I led her to the couch, she sat and I ran back to the microwave to get out the popcorn. I got the biggest bowl I could find, and dumped the bag of pooped kernels into the bowl. I showed my friends a few options of movies we could watch and she picked out a new comedy. I opened the DVD player, took out the disc and put it in. I sat down next to my friend on the couch and pressed play on the remote.",

I waited for our waiter to return. When he did, I explained that my meal wasn't very good. I told him the chicken was served cold and the dressing was far too salty. He apologized and offered to get me a new one. I agreed. He went to the back and had the chef make me a new chicken salad.

                "text": "Omelettes are one of my favorite breakfast foods, so I grabbed a skillet's from the pantry, place it on the skillet and turned on the heat to medium in order to get ready to cook them. While the skillet was heating up, I cracked two eggs, and the and the contents of the shell into an empty bowl and discarding the white cells. I beat the eggs until the yoke and egg white had combines, then added a few splashes of milk and continued beating. Once I was satisfied with the consistency of the egg of the omelette, then I prepared the contents that will go inside. I already had a bacon that have been cooked previously, so I crushed the bacon with my hands in order to make crumbles. I also grabbed a bag of cheddar cheese from the refrigerator, as well as an onion. I cut a few slivers of onion off, and chop them into fine pieces. Now that I have all of my ingredients prepared, I pour the egg into the preheated skillet and let the egg cover the bottom surface of the skillet. Once I felt the ad was halfway cooked, I use a spatula to lift and flip the egg over to the other side. Immediately after flipping the egg, I placed my crumbled bacon, diced onion, and shredded cheddar cheese on one side of the circular cooking egg. I then use my spatula to close the omelette, flipping the uncovered side of the egg on top of the bacon, cheese and onion that was situated on the other side of the egg. Once the egg was properly closed, I then use a spatula to turn the omelette over so that it may continue cooking on the other side, and turning off the heat. After about 40 seconds of cooking, I then use a spatula to remove the omelette from the skillet, and place it on the plate so I can begin eating.",

It was gonna be an omelette , a mushroom omelette. But I had no eggs at home. I could have  eaten cereal for breakfast but decided to have omelette since that is what I had decided. So I went for a  quick walk at 7:30 to the nearby shop. I bought a dozen of eggs and was at home by 7:40. I heated up the pan , poured some oil and sauteed the mushrooms , at the same time I broke open two eggs , added some milk , salt , chilies, garlic to mix and whipped it good. When the mushroom was nicely I sauteed I added the eggs. I let it set and flipped it. Enjoyed it with nice buttered toast and a big glass of orange juice.",

When I arrived at the wedding, I was greeted by Eric's parents who were very nice, friendly, and welcoming. Once my partner and I found our seats, we said hello to our friends and also met some new people. After about a half an hour of socializing, it was time for the ceremony to begin. It was a beautiful ceremony. I cried because I was so happy for Eric and his partner. After the ceremony, it was time for brunch. We had the choice of biscuits and gravy or pancakes. I chose the biscuits and gravy dish. We were also served an assortment of family style sides, like bacon and home fries. It was a really fun wedding and I enjoyed myself.",

After enough time would pass since one of them would send me or my family a letter, I would begin to work on one. I would write for a few minutes, usually talking about things that my family recently did, and asking them how they've been doing. If possible, I would even attach pictures to the letter, so they could see what we've been up to. I would then close up the letter in an envelope, stamp it, and write on their address. The next morning, I'd drop it in my mailbox for the postman to pick it up and take it to the post office. Usually, they would write back within a week responding to my letter.",

Mother puts hot water into the kettle and sets it on the stove. We gather all of the plastic cups from our grocery store play set and put them on the table in front of the teddy bears. Then we sit at the big table and wait... \"Wheeeee\" said the kettle as mother scurries over to take it off of the stove. Gives up each a teacup with little flowers on it, and then puts a tea bag in each one. The teddy bears will have to pretend. Then she puts a dish with sugar in it on the table, too. When she pours the water into our cups, the teabag turns the water brown! It's like magic. Then when we are done making the water brown, we take out the teabags and plop a little bit of sugar into our cups. Then we stir it and sip our tea. I love tea parties with Veronica and Megan.",

We are going to the beach so I know it will be hot. I took my suitcase out and opened it. I started by putting my sandals and extra pair of shoes towards the bottom. Then i packed my nice and folded pair of pants and some shorts also. Next came some shirts for the daytime, to go swimming, and to sleep in. Then I packed my underwear and some socks. I put my big beach towel folded on top of everything so it would fit. I thought what else I should take. Then I remembered I need sunscreen so I went to get it and put it on one of the side pockets of the suitcase. I also got my toothbrush and a small toothpaste tube and put those on the side pocket. Last I got my water goggles and packed those in too. I made sure all the zippers closed so nothing falls out and I was ready to go on our trip.",

In our case, it's been a while since the baby last ate, and he's getting a little \u201cfussy,\u201d so he's probably hungry.  (It's probably time to change his diaper, too, but that's another story.)  His Mom is at work, but she left some milk in a bottle in the refrigerator.  So the first thing to do is set the baby down in a safe place.  We'll put him in his monkey chair and strap him in.  Then we need to pour some water in the bottom of a pot, put the pot on the stove, turn on the heat, and put the bottle with the milk in the water at the bottom of the pot to heat up the milk.  After a bit, we remove the bottle from the water and flick a little milk on our wrist to make sure it's warm but not too hot.  When the milk is just the right temperature, we turn off the stove, remove the bottle from the pot, remove the baby from the monkey seat and head for the couch.  Then we cradle the little tyke, show him the bottle, and let him do the rest.  When he's finished, turn him face down over your shoulder and pat him a few times to let him burp if he needs to.  Mission accomplished.  Go change his diaper.",

I brought my tennis racket and some tennis balls to the park and met my friend there. We went into the court and each picked a side of the court. I was on the left side of the net and my friend was on the right. It was my turn to serve, so I threw the ball I was holding up and hit it over the net. The ball bounced on the floor past the net and my friend hit the ball back to me. I was fast and jumped up to hit the ball before it hit the floor. The ball whizzed past my friend and he could not hit it back. I scored a point. I won the game a few minutes later after we hit the ball back and forth some more.",

I grabbed the basked and brought it to my washer and dryer machine. I took out detergent from closed above. Added one cup of detergent in machine tray of washer and I also added cloths softener in the tray besides the detergent tray in my washer machine. Then I set it up the machine timer to one hour. I started the machine and then I waited for one hour while watching TV. Then I removed clothes from washer machined and put in in dryer machine, I set the timer to hour and again waited for an hour while watching TV. I heard the beep when drying was done. So I went back to machine and remove dry clothes from it and put it in a clean basket. And that is how my cloth washing session ended.",

I took a container of French vanilla from the pantry along with a clean filter.  I measured 2 tablespoons of coffee into the filter.  I removed the filter holder from my coffee machine and put the clean filter with the french vanilla coffee into it, relishing the aroma.  I clicked the holder into place.  Then I took the glass carafe from the machine and filled it with cold water.  I poured the water into the area above the filter and turned the machine on.  I could hear the water heating and within a few minutes hot water was running down over the coffee grounds and then dripping into the carafe.  When all the water had run over the beans, I poured some into my favorite mug and added a little bit of cream and some sugar.  I left the rest for my family to enjoy when they got up.",

Both of them grabbed a pen from the drawer by the kitchen phone, and sat down at the table to begin discussing how they were going to pay all the incoming bills for the months to come. Fred had been laid off for two weeks at the beginning of the month, so things had been a little tighter than usual. Mary wrote checks for the household bills; cable, water, electric, gas, and sewer. Fred wrote checks for home and entertainment; the mortgage, all the credit cards, and any shopping bills for clothing and groceries. They both preferred to work in silence, and enjoyed the moment when they had addressed and stamped all the envelopes, then went outside to put them in the mailbox together. Fred kissed her when they got to the front door.",

I made sure to wear eye and mouth protection while doing this, so I wouldn't get hurt myself.  Finally, I rinsed the cleaner off of the tub to make the entire area sparkling clean.  After cleaning the tub, I found a scrub brush for the toilet, along with some toilet cleaner, and scrubbed the inside of the toilet bowl.  I used tile cleaner to get the outside of the toilet, before wiping it down with a clean rag.  The last thing I did was get a damp rag and wipe down the sink to make the bathroom nice and clean.",

Ten minutes later I heard someone call my name. It was a woman who was dressed in hospital scrubs and she said she was the assistant to the dentist. She introduced herself and showed me what room to go to. I entered the room and was introduced to the dentist. I then sat down in the chair and had my dental check up. They had me open my mouth and inspect my teeth. I also got my teeth cleaned. After they were finished, my appointment was over. They said goodbye and I had went to the front desk to check out and tell them I was leaving. I then went to my car and drove myself home.",

He had filleted the fish as soon as he returned to the dock and now he rinsed and dried each fillet. He took some saltine crackers and crushed them in a plastic bag, using a rolling pin. He poured the crumbs onto a plate. He put some flour on another plate and added some salt and pepper and mixed them with the flour. Next, Allan cracked two eggs into a bowl and added a couple of spoonfuls of water. With a fork, he quickly stirred the egg and water until they were blended together. Allan put a large frying pan on his stove and turned on the burner. He added oil to about a half an inch. While the oil was heating, he took one fillet in his right hand and set it in the flour mixture and completely covered the fish. He then took the fillet and dipped it in the egg and then set the fish on the cracker crumbs. He turned the fish and pressed on the crumbs until the fillet was coated. He then carefully set the breaded fillet into the hot oil. When the edges of the fillet were starting to brown, he took tongs and carefully turned the fillet over. In just a few minutes, the bottom edges were also browning so he removed the fish from the pan with the tongs. He set the fish on some paper towels to soak up the excess oil and then moved it to his dinner plate.",

We looked for airlines that had flights from our city to Florida on the days we wanted to fly. We made a list of those possibilities on the computer. Next we compared the prices, because we did not want to pay too much. We found the one that had the lowest cost and selected that one. We typed in our information, like our name and phone number and email, and then we paid for the tickets with a credit card online. We printed out the receipt and the directions for how to get our tickets and boarding pass. We would need to take those with us when it was time to go to the airport to leave.

It was about the middle of the day, and I heard my phone ring. The phone number was unknown to me, and the only thing I recognized was the area code. Because of this, I answered the phone and was pleasantly surprised to hear the voice of one of my good friends on the other line. Once I knew that it was in fact one of my friends, we talked on the phone for about 2 hours just trying to catch up with what we've been doing.

I went to the medicine cabinet and found a bottle of cough syrup. I ready the directions printed on the side of the label, and determined the amount of cough syrup to administer. I also got a small, clear plastic medicine cup out of the cabinet to measure out the amount of syrup to pour based on the child's weight. The child needed two tablespoons of the syrup according to the directions, so I poured out that amount into the cup and gave the cup to the  child to drink. I encouraged him to completely drink the cup of medicine so that he would have relief from his coughing. Afterwards, I rinsed out the cup, put the lid on the bottle, and put it back in the cabinet.",

One of the reasons that we like going to this city so much, apart from all the things there is to do, is going to the beach. We would always make sure to pack some beachwear or swimwear with all of our normal clothes because of this. We would all go to the beach dressed in our beachwear, so that we wouldn't have to worry about finding a bathroom to change in. There was so much fun things to do there when we recently went. One of the things that me and my younger brother did was buy some molds from a nearby shop to make sand castles with. Another thing that I did was sunbathe, with a beach towel to lay down on while I felt the sun on my skin. My brother and my mom actually went into the water, something that I've always been nervous about doing. After we'd had enough, we dried ourselves off with the towels, hopped back in the car, and went back to our hotel room.",

Even though sharing is caring, I find it to be crowded in the pool and distracting sharing a lane. I drove to the YMCA, about 15 minutes. I then parked my car and went inside. I then changed into my bathing suit. I proceeded to swim for about 35 minutes. Mostly just the front crawl, and back stroke. I also used the kicking board for about 200 meters or 4 laps of a 50 meter pool. Finally, I finished my swim. This YMCA has a hot tub so I then soaked in the hot tub for a half hour to relax my muscles. I then went back to the locker room, showered, and changed back into my work clothes before leaving.",

He started with the shirts and continued to fold them. He made sure they were folded nicely and put them in a pile to put in the dresser. He then proceeded to fold his socks. He just shoved one matching sock into another and put those in a pile. He continued folding his laundry, he finished folding his underwear, jeans, and everything else he needed to fold.

I decided to fix the room up, to renovate it. I sold all the furniture I did not want in the room and started fresh. I painted the walls a color that I liked much more than the old one. I bought some curtains that looked nice over the windows in the room. The curtains looked good with the walls too. I also bought a nicer couch with money I had saved up, one that was nice and soft and felt good to sit on. There were also some lamps that looked good on a table in the room that I bought. The last thing I decided to do was hang some art on the wall behind the couch, which made the room look very good. I had finished my renovations.",

I went through my schedule paying special attention to what I was doing each day. I then made sure I was covered in terms of an outfit for that day, loading them all into the suitcase. Certain meetings required a jacket and tie, so I made sure to bring my suit jacket and several ties. I also included two pairs of dress shoes to go with the more formal outfits. I then set out enough underwear and socks to cover the whole trip and packed those in a separate compartment. I packed my tennis shoes, too, and a pair of casual loafers. I then packed some T-shirts and shorts, as well as my bathing suit. Lastly, I packed all my toiletries like my shaver, my toothbrush, hairbrush, and medications. I was all set for my trip and only needed one suitcase to do it.",

It doesn't really matter what the little girl's name was, but we'll call her Jenny.  The first thing Jenny needed to do to get her breakfast ready was to make orange juice.  Jenny didn't want to go to school, much less make orange juice, so Jenny told her mommy that she had forgotten how to make orange juice.  Jenny's mommy -- we'll call her Mommy -- was not stupid and did not believe Jenny but Mommy decided that this would be a great learning opportunity for both of them so she went along with it.  Mommy took an orange that she had bought at the market just the day before.  Mommy took a sharp knife and very carefully cut the orange into two equal halves.  Then, she gently removed the orange peels from each half.  After that, she opened the electric juicer sitting on the kitchen counter and tossed in both halves of the orange before closing the lid and starting the juicer.  Seconds later, fresh orange juice poured into the little jar at the bottom of the device.  When the machine was finished, Mommy handed the jar to Jenny and said, \"Crisis averted.  Go upstairs and get ready for school.\"  Jenny pouted but drank the fresh orange juice before sullenly going upstairs to get ready for another day of learning.  Jenny was seventeen years old.",

When I got home I got the list I made of people to invite so I did not forget anyone. I got out my address book and found everyone's address to put on the envelope . After they were collected and wrote down on the invites it was time to get stamps. I got them out of the desk and began filling out the envelopes. After the envelopes were done I put the invitations in them, sealed the envelope, and put a stamp on the right corner.  I mailed out all the invitations and was excited for the party to come.",

I placed the pot with water on the stove, and turned the heat on to high. While I allow the water to heat to boiling on the stove, I removed a teabag from the box, unwrapping it's from the foil and preparing it for use. I then selected my cup that I wish to drink my tea from, and placed the prepared teabag inside of the cup. After about five minutes, the water had begun to boil, so I removed the pots from the stove and poured hot water into my cup. I filled the cup with water, allowing the teabag to be submerged in the hot water, and watched as the teabag turned the water into a brownish color. I placed the pots back on the stove, and turned the heat completely off. I then grabbed my cup with one hand, and the papers them of the teabag and began to dock the teabag in a up and down motion while in the water. This encouraged the water to turn darker as more of the flavor and aroma from the teabag became dissolved into the hot water. After performing the up-and-down motion for about a minute, I placed the cup on the table, allowing the bag to sit in the water a little longer, and allow the water to cool off. After about five minutes, I took the teabag out of the water, and put in a spoonful of sugar to sweeten the tea, then I stirred the tea and sugar so that I may begin to drink the tea.",

Coffee has caffeine in it, which is good at waking people up and giving them energy. Too much caffeine is bad though and can make you feel nervous. I make sure to only drink coffee every now and then to stay healthy. Coffee is made from pouring hot water on coffee beans, and a coffee maker does this for you. I make sure that the coffee maker has enough water in it, and put coffee beans that have been smashed up into the top. The coffee is easier to make when the beans are smashed up, so people normally smash the beans into grounds. I turn the coffee maker on, and it heats up the water and pours it into the coffee grounds. The water passes through the machine and falls out as coffee into a cup I put at the bottom. My coffee is hot and ready, and smells good.",

My tire had a leak so I bought a repair kit . I had no idea how to use it but I did find out . I had to take the whole wheel off the bicycle . Next I pried the tires from the rim and that took some doing . Okay once I got that off I had to take the inner tube out also and I learned that I had to be very careful with the inner tube because I could cause more damage by being rough . Next , I took the inner tube to the gas station to get air since I did n't have a manual air pump . I learned really quickly that I needed to fill the inner tube with care or I would be buying another one since the air fills it quickly and the tube can pop . Once I put a little air in the tube I had to listen as I pressed the air out to determine where the leak was actually at . Once the leak location was identified then I was able to take the tube home and use the glue from the kit and apply the rubber patch . Of course I had to allow the tube to dry and then deflate it to get it back on the bicycle . Once I got it all put back together I walked my bike back to the gas station for air .",

The first thing I did was take both of our suitcases down the hall to the laundry room. I dumped out all of our dirty clothes. I sorted into 3 piles- the towels and thick items that don't have any wash restrictions. The second pile was my clothes, which many need to be hung up, but I like to use a strong smelling detergent. The third pile consisted of all of my son's clothes, as well as any delicate items, such as bathing suits that will be washed in a free and clear detergent, as my son has skin allergies. I placed one load into the washing machine, with the appropriate detergent. When it was done, I put the clothes in the dryer or hung those that cannot dry. I added a dryer sheet and started the process over with the next batch. It take time, but sorting it out is the best way to tackle the task.",

I walk over to the fridge and open the crisper drawer and pull out whatever vegetable I feel like eating; usually a carrot, cucumber or tomato. I rinse the produce off and set it on my bamboo cutting board. I pick up the knife (preferably a santoku) and begin slicing by pushing down and forward and then pulling back while still pressing down. The knife should be held in somewhat of a fist without any fingers extended. I push each slice away from the main piece each time. Once I am down I pick up the cutting board and use the knife to slide the vegetable slices into a dish.",

The search engine pulled-up several restaurants including One Table which makes online reservations. There were several listing on the site, so we chose one nearby and had received rave reviews on another site. The restaurant is called Takorea and it's about four miles away. There was link to make our dinner reservations on the site. Great. That makes it very convenient. On the site, you had to first select your restaurant, of course. Then it requested and date, party number and time. There were several options to choose from for time so taking into consideration of traffic and parking, we made our reservation for the two of us on Friday, June 2, at 7:30 pm. The site requested we show up a few minutes early in case the table opens up sooner. I'm really looking forward to going tomorrow.",

I was particularly looking for some nice sea food, so that why I narrowed down my list to 3. Then I looked for review of the restaurants, and I found one restaurant called\" little island\". I went through the menu items, and I Liked all the items that was on buffet that evening.  They recommended lunch buffet for more varieties.  So I decided to go with lunch buffet.  I made reservation for 40 people, between 12pm to 3 pm. They gave me some discount as I told them to use recycled material, and I participated in their volunteering program.",

I looked at a bunch of magazines and different bathrooms to get inspiration on how I wanted my newly renovated bathroom to look.  I decided to do marble counters and ceramic floor tiles.  I also decided to redo the shower with a frameless glass shower door and chrome fixtures.  I then asked friends and family for referrals on contractors.  I contacted three different contractors that my friends referred to me as reliable and got some bids.  The bids were very close in price but different in when they could start and finish.  I picked the person who I thought gave me a realistic time frame on when the work could be done.  The work started and the contractor demolished the existing bathroom but then took over a week to come back and renovate the bathroom.  It took longer than I thought it would but the end result is great.  I love my new bathroom.  It is exactly the way I want it to be.",

It is much easier to do so today using the Internet, so I went online and searched for flights from New York to Wisconsin. There are so many flights each day, so it was important to pick one at a good date and time without too long of a layover or stop anywhere. I found a flight that was at a good time, and only had a short stop in Chicago each direction, so I booked that ticket. I was able to choose my seat and pay online, I got a confirmation number and was ready to go. I made sure to get to the airport early enough so that I could print my boarding passes, check my luggage, and get through security. After that I was good to go, and off to see my family.",

The website took all of this information and gave me a price. It was a fair price, so I clicked the \"accept\" button and entered my credit card information into the form on the website.

There were paintings and drawings.  There were ceramics.  There were sculptures.  I went to see the paintings first.  There were some paintings by famous artists.  Other paintings were by artists I had never heard of.  I enjoyed the paintings of still life, such as flowers and fruit.  Next I went to see the ceramics display.  Some of the pottery was over 1,000 years old.  The designs on the pottery were detailed and very pretty.  Some of the pieces were brightly colored and others were brown and beige.  Some of the pottery was damaged and pieces were missing. There was some Chinese pottery and it had colorful dragons painted on it.   I enjoyed looking at all of the different styles and designs.  Finally I went to see the sculptures.  I liked the sculptures of horses.  There was a sculpture of a man riding on a horse that I particularly liked.  The man was an Indian and was wearing only pants and a feather in his hair.  He had a fierce expression on his face. It was easy to imagine him riding into battle on his horse.  After visiting the exhibits in the museum for several hours I was tired, so I got in my car and drove home.",

I actually keep a list going on a magnetic notepad on the fridge and one on my phone whenever I know I am out or low on something . I try to only go once a week unless there is something I really need for a specific meal . I take my electronic list with me to the store , but I often still walk up and down most aisles just browsing for anything new or that I might want to try . I like to keep a rough estimate of how much I am buying by rounding up . So if a can of soup is $ 1.50 I think $ 2 and keep adding that as I shop if I 'm wanting to stay on a specific budget . Once I have all my items in my cart I go to the checkout line that seems to have the least amount of people in it . I do n't like to jump lines if one line seems to be moving faster . Good to have a little bit of patience . I try to remember to bring my bags with me so that I 'm not always getting plastic bags .",

There is an underground rail line that runs from nearby my house and takes me directly to the city where I work. My train typically leaves at 6:43 a.m. so I am sure to arrive at the station at 6:30. I wait amongst all the other people who commute to work and eat some breakfast I had prepared for myself the night before. Once the train arrives, people shuffle on board and find themselves either a bench to sit in, or space in which to stand. The ride takes about an hour with a couple of stops along the way. During the trip, if I am lucky to find a bench, I bring my laptop out and begin my work for the day. If I must stand I typically try to strike up conversation with my neighbor.",

She then passed a vacuum over all of the floor to make sure that they were nice and clean.  I wanted to clean the bathroom, so I went in there with glass cleaner and toilet bowel cleaner to make sure that it was very clean.  I poured the toilet bowel cleaner into the porcelain toilet and scrubbed the inside and outside to ensure that it was clean.  The kitchen was then cleaned by my wife with a rag and a good cleaner.

I decided to get a newspaper, so I drove to the grocery store, where there is a newspaper box that has the daily paper. I went to the newspaper box and realized I didn't have any change; papers from the paper box cost fifty cents. I went into the grocery store and bought some groceries, and when I was paying for my groceries I asked the cashier to give me a dollar's worth of quarters in with my change. I went back outside to the paper box and put two quarters into the box to get my paper. I took the newspaper and drove home to look at the advertisements.",

Driving to one in a car would take up too much of my fun vacation time . I had to buy tickets for an airplane ride , which would take much less time because airplanes go very fast . I went to the website of my local airport and found the available planes traveling to the city where I wanted to go at the time I was going on vacation and bought a ticket . The planes were ready to fly only at certain times . When it came time to go on my trip , I packed up my suitcases , drove to the airport before my plane was ready to fly , and parked my car . Inside the airport , I had to go through a long line for security , so that they can make sure there are no dangerous items being taken on the plane . The workers looked inside my suitcases with an X-Ray machine and checked the clothing I was wearing to make sure I was safe , too . When I was all done in security , I had to find the gate for my plane , where it would be ready to pick me and other passengers up . When it was time to board the plane , the stewardess helped me find my assigned seat and put my suitcase in the compartment above me . I buckled my seat belt and waited for the plane to take off . When all the passengers were on board , the stewardess explained what to do in an emergency , and the plane began to move . It became very noisy and all of a sudden , outside the window , I could see the ground get farther away . I felt like my body was being pushed against my seat a little bit . After a few minutes , the plane stopped going up and the stewardess told us we could take our seat belts off . She offered us drinks from a cart , and I was able to read a book I brought on the plane . I knew the ride would last a fair amount of time , so I made sure I had something to do . After a few hours , the captain explained on the intercom that we were arriving in the city . He told us to buckle our seat belts again , and the plane gently came closer to the ground . Finally , I felt a bump as the plane arrived at the airport in the new city . My plane ride was over , and my beach vacation was beginning .",

I bought chicken legs and pork ribs at the grocery store. I knew that a few people that would be coming do not eat meat so I made sure to have plenty of options. I made baked beans, cole slaw and grilled corn. I also made a Mexican salad that had corn, beans and some tortilla chips in it. There were going to be about 5 children there so I made sure to have games for them to play and I even bought some balloons for a water balloon toss. I told people to bring their bathing suits as well so they could swim. I turned out to be a fun day and everyone really enjoyed themselves.",

On the phone, I had to give the time, as well as my name and amount of people in my party. Upon arriving at the restaurant, there was already a seat ready and we got seated quickly. Many people were waiting outside and I was so thankful that I made a reservation. I called and made the reservation, but I also realized that if I was interested, I could have made  the reservation online and it would have showed me my place in line.

We spread out on the long benches beside the pit with burning hot rocks. We all took turns spooning water out of the bucket onto the stones to get the steam flowing; we let the heat wash over us, open up our pores and seep into our muscles. It was fun sitting with my friends enjoying the steam, I even stretched out on the bench and it made the whole experience even better. After an hour of soaking up the hot vapors we decided it was long enough; so we gathered our towels and went to cool off with a cold shower. It was a great way to spend a day and I can't wait to do it again.",

I walked around to the other side, making sure it was all even.  After the sheets were fixed, I did the same thing with the comforter.  I made sure everything was nice and wrinkle free.  That's when I put the pillows back on the bed.  I arranged them neatly, one on top of the other.  The open part of the pillowcase was put facing the wall, because that looks cleaner to me.

While they cooked, I got out some cheese, ham, chopped onion, and chopped green peppers.  When the eggs looked fairly well set on top, I placed the cheese, ham, and vegetables on top.  Then, with a spatula, I carefully folded the omelette in half covering the fillings.  I put a lid on the pan and let it heat a little longer until the cheese was melted.  Then I ate my omelette!",

I get into his car and am sweating and visibly stresses. The cab driver, a man named Marcus, asks how I am doing in a very down to Earth way. I let him know I am fine and was just in a rush. As I finish my sentence I hear a man on his radio say \"You just got to relax.\" Marcus was playing some peaceful reggae music, and just hearing that line was enough for me to do that.

I check them on decide on the website which offers the best deal on the sketchbook with free shipping. They will also gift wrap and send a message in my package.

Seeing it as a good opportunity to gain some experience in caring for a baby, I would accept. Turns out that it was not that easy. My baby cousin is awfully loud and cries a lot. Thankfully, my aunt told me of a trick that works to calm him down and get him to nap. Also going off of what she told me, I would feed him at specific times. However, he liked to make a mess with the baby food, so it was a bit of a hassle. Then there were the times I needed to change his diaper. With my mom's help, I was able to clean him up good and put on a new diaper.",

Just rest, and I'll see you there. I love you. I'll save you a cheeseburger,\" I teased as I kissed him goodbye. He grinned at me and beeped my nose, \"I love you Sally Jean,: He said with an exaggerated southern drawl. He then turned and gave our four young boys the evil eye, \"I expect you to be good and eat lots of hamburgers and hot dogs at the barbecue.\" They all nodded in unison and screamed, \"Hamburgers!\" like wild Indians.

I would collect all of the toys that are on the floor and sort them into different piles. For example, I would put all of the Legos in one pile, dolls in one pile, toy cars in one pile, and games in one pile. I would then put the Legos into the box or container that they came in. I would do the same with the other toys and then I would gather all the the toys that I had put back in their original boxes and I would put then into one big toy box. There might be a few toys that I would not put away, like a special doll that my child might want to have with her throughout the day or take to bed with her at night.",

I picked the one that looked really good to me.  I looked at how much it would cost and how long it would take to get to my house.  When I decided on a shaver, I decided that I would pay for it now and have it come to my house.  I put in my information to pay for the shaver and they told me they would send it to me in the mail.

                "text": "This past Monday, my family had a small party at my house. One of the main foods that we had to eat were hot dogs. My cousins were the ones who had the idea to eat hot dogs, so they took them over to the house to make. My dad was using our barbecue grill to do all of the cooking, so that's how he cooked the hot dogs. After letting them cook for the amount of time that they needed to, my dad gave the cooked hot dogs to my aunt to prepare them. She put each individual hot dog in a bun and added ketchup, mustard, cheese, and onions. For anyone that wanted it, she also added some of her homemade chili instead of the ketchup and mustard. Everyone at the party seemed to really enjoy the hot dogs, and so did I. Now we know to have hot dogs at any parties we do next time.",

There are stations all around the city, so I had to find the one that was closest to my destination so I wouldn't have to walk too far after I got off. When I got to the station, I walked down the stairs that led into the underground and went over to the kiosk so I could pay my fee. After I paid my fee I took the ticket and went through the turnstile towards the train. I had to wait with a group of people for the train to arrive, but it didn't take very long. When the train got to my station the doors slowly slid open and everyone walked inside. We found our seats and waited patiently for the train to start moving. I didn't take long. Soon, a nice voice came over the intercom announcing my destination was the next stop, so I stood up and waited to exit the train.",

Then the competition really had started to begin Vivian tossed an overhand throw towards Courtney. That really made Courtney mad so she decided it was time to pull out a secret move that she had been working on called: The Mega sword death punch as soon as Courtney had performed that moved on Vivian she could feel the heat coming at her and he knew that she had to get out out of the way of the ball. when Vivian opened her eyes, she could see the ball and her entire side of the tennis court up in flames! Vivian thought it was best for her to go home and wait for Courtney to call her from there. Courtney was left to clean up the mess, but she didn't think twice. She called an uber and went home. She went straight to bed and dint call Vivian again.",

Then, I got out a loaf of bread and took out two pieces.  I put each piece into one half of the toaster in the little slots.  I didn't want my bread to be too burnt, so I turned down the setting so it wasn't going to be in the toaster for so long.  I pushed the lever down and the bread started to cook in the toaster.  While it was cooking, I got out some butter and a knife so I could put that on the toast.  When the toast was finished, the pieces popped outside of the toaster, ready to pull out.  I pulled them out and put them on a plate and put butter on both of the pieces.",

We had a lot in common and she was definitely flirting with me and I flirted back. I eventually worked up the courage to ask her on a date,  I don't know why I was so nervous (I knew she'd say yes.) I asked what kind of food she liked and she said sushi or Chinese. I was happy because that is also my favorite type of food. we set the date for the following Wednesday, we chose Wednesday because restaurants tend to be less crowded on a Wednesday after noon, and she has social anxiety. Wednesday came and I got up early and did my daily routine. I showered and dressed in my best casual yet classy clothing, put on my favorite cologne and made sure I had my phone, keys and wallet with cards inside. I called her to let her know I was on my way and would be there around 11 a.m. She was super happy sounding and said she'd be ready. I arrived and knocked on the door and was greeted by her in a beautiful and elegant sundress that made her bright green eyes and auburn hair pop. She was amazing. At the restaurant we were both very quiet, but smiled a lot at each other while stuffing out faces with freshly made sushi and egg rolls. I paid for us both and she offered to leave the tip.",

I then got the powder, and powdered the baby's butt.  After that, I grabbed a diaper from the bag and I put on a fresh clean diaper on the baby.  Then I put on the baby's pants and clothes on and the baby was now happy.  The baby stopped crying and was now finally comfortable.  I then put the baby back in the crib to sleep.",

We decided to decorate everything while he was at work so he wouldn't see. Then, we planned what kinds of activities we wanted to have at the party. We decided to get a pi\u00f1ata, some fun water balloon games for our backyard, and of course, a big cake for everyone to share. On the big day, we decorated our house and once my roommate got there, everyone hid in their places to jump out and surprise him. We yelled \"surprise!\" and my roommate was so shocked! He was really happy that we had thought of him on his birthday and he loved everything we had planned for his party. It was a great day for everyone.",

I couldn't book online, but I made a note to go in on Sunday. When Sunday came around, I waited in a short line behind a few other people. I paid for my ticket without hassle. Once everyone had their tickets, a guide met us and led the group through the museum. I saw lots of exhibits: paintings, sculptures, pottery, and more. The group eventually split up and I explored the museum on my own. There was so much to see in the museum. Even if I'd stayed all day, there was no way I could have seen all of it. At the end of my trip, I went to the souvenir store and bought myself a few trinkets. It was great!",

I filled the pot to the brim with water and placed the pot on the stove. I turned the heat on high so that the water would boil. While I was waiting for the water to boil I entered my pantry and chose the type of pasta I would be making. I had various choices such as spaghetti, penne, angel hair and elbow macaroni. I decided on penne. Approximately twenty minutes after I placed the water to boil on the stove the water was at a rolling boil which is perfect for cooking pasta. I turned the heat down on the stove to medium. I grabbed an empty bowl from my cupboard and filled it with penne pasta so I had one serving. I dumped the bowl of pasta in the water. After doing this I added a pinch of salt because it gives the pasta flavor. I took a wooden spoon and stirred the pasta occasionally. After about fifteen minutes I took my wooden spoon and tried the texture of the pasta to ensure it was filly cooked and tender. It was so I grabbed a strainer under my cupboard and placed it in the sink. I took the pasta off the stove and dumped it into the strainer. I bounced the strainer up and down to make sure there wasn't an excess of water. Once there was no more water I put the pasta into a bowl and chose my sauce. I enjoyed my pasta.",

I was going to cook some chicken and steaks that I had for whoever wanted them, but my friends were also going to bring some of their own food to cook as well. My barbecue grill is in my backyard. Before cooking I put several pieces of hickory wood at the bottom of the grill with some small sticks and paper to get the pieces of wood burning. A few minutes after catching fire the flames went out but the wood turned white and stayed really hot. That's when I knew its was time to start cooking the meat. Throughout the day me and my friends would keep putting food on and off the grill for whoever was hungry while everyone else was either hanging around outside or staying inside to stay out of the heat. I had about 15 people at my house and the last people didn't leave until late in the evening. It was my first barbecue of the summer and I can't wait to do it again.",

We took out our automatic payment cards, walked up to the barrier, and swiped them across the electronic reader. The barrier opened to let us in. We walked up to the map that shows how the different train lines run. We confirmed that we would have to change trains halfway there. We looked at the signs to locate the platform we needed, and walked down another flight of steps to catch our train. We waited on the platform at a safe distance until the train came roaring in. After it came to a stop and the other passengers got off, we entered the train. It was mostly empty and we were able to find seats. At the third stop we got off and quickly walked up another flight of steps to locate the platform for the next train. In two minutes our next train arrived and we got on. This train was crowded and we had to stand. Four stops later we arrived at our destination. We left the train and walked towards the exit.  We passed another set of barriers and swiped our cards again, and then took an escalator up out of the underground to the street.",

We then will add a little bit of soap. The soap is a special soap just for washing dishes and is usually right by the sink in a big plastic bottle. We will squeeze the bottle and add two or three drops of soap. After the water is warm and soapy we can take our dirty plate and dip it in the water. We will wet a cloth with the warm water and rub the plate until it is clean. We then will turn the faucet on on the other side of the sink and rinse the plate under clean water. When we are all finished we will take a dry towel and dry the dish until it is no longer wet. We then have a clean dish!",

Then we spread a clean table cloth and put an attractive flower vase in the middle. We arranged the vase with fresh, beautiful flowers. Now comes the arrangement of plates. We placed dinner plates, small plates and glasses for drinks for each chair count. Then we arranged spoons on the left hand side and forks on the right hand side of the plates. Then we neatly folded dining napkins and kept near each plate. A stand filled with extra spoons and forks was also kept in the middle of the table. A separate stand with tissue papers were also placed. We sprayed mild air freshner under the table so that our guests could get good fragrance during the dinner time. Our dining dining able is perfectly ready for dinner.",

Some people with lots of children wash clothes everyday. To wash clothes you need to gather all the dirty clothes and use a laundry machine. Some people have laundry machines at home and some people need to go to a wash house to use laundry machines. The wash houses have all different size machines and some take coins and other wash houses take cards. To wash the clothes you have to separate by color so that all the white clothes are together and all the colored clothing is together. Also if you have sheets and towels you want to wash those separately. When you find a machine that is the right size for the clothes you need to wash you add the clothes and then follow the directions to see how much laundry soap you add. Some people use liquid laundry soap and some people use powder laundry soap. You can even do a mixture or combination but make sure to use the right amount. After adding the clothes and the soap you pay for the machine and wait 30 minutes to 1 hour for the clothes to wash. After the clothes are washed you still need to put them in a dryer unless they are delicate clothes that are not supposed to go into the dryer because they might shrink. You take the clothes and put them in the dryer but make sure not to put anything that might shrink. For the delicate clothes you hang them to dry. After you put all your clothes into the dryers it is time to fold the laundry! This is important so the laundry will be nice and neat and not wrinkled. If you have long pants or nice shirts you can put them on hangers instead of folding.",

I turned the burner on to medium.  I added 8 strips of bacon.  I let the bacon cook on one side, and then I flipped the bacon.  I allowed it to cook on the other side, and then I removed it.  I placed the bacon on paper towels so it would drain.  I then poured some of the bacon grease from the pan into a aluminum can.  I heated the pan back up, and added the eggs.

I laid out a disposable diaper in his size and baby wipes. I took off his shorts and his dirty diaper, using it to clean up some of the mess from his bottom. I folded it over so that the outside that was clean was underneath him. I then used the wipes to clean up any mess that was leftover on his bottom. Once he was adequately clean, I grabbed a new diaper and slipped the back under his bottom. I made sure to talk to him throughout the entire process, and gave him a rattle to play with so that he was distracted. I pulled the tabs on the sides of his diaper across the front and secured them around his waist. I put his shorts back on, picked him up, and threw away the dirty diaper. He felt much better and was ready to play afterwards.",

I signaled to an oncoming yellow taxi that I needed a ride by sticking out my arm and waving. A taxi driver soon stopped there at the curb and picked me up. I opened the back door and climbed into the backseat. After climbing in and shutting the door, I gave him the address to where my meeting was taking place. The taxi driver then drove me to the address I had given him and made some small talk about the weather. When we arrived at my destination, I thanked him, and he told me how much the fare was. I gave him some money, and he gave me change because I gave him more than was needed. I then exited the vehicle and closed the door and headed to my meeting.",

Once they're done drying, I'll still go over each of them with a paper towel just to make sure that I got any wet spots left behind.

Mother gets red meat out of the fridge and puts it in the frying pan. Then she sprinkles spices onto the meat and I hear it sizzle. Sometimes I eat a tomato when mother isn't looking. Next we get out the cheese and grate little pieces off of the big block with a metal thing. When the meat is all done we put it into a bowl. Then we get out the taco shells and put them on the table. Once everything is all chopped up, we take it to the table and call my Dad and sister to eat. \"It smells great!\" my dad says. My sister doesn't like tacos, but I love taco night! Tacos are my favorite dinner.",

We went shopping at the  supermarket for the  ingredients. When we got back, it was about noon so we got into the kitchen to prepare the lunch. We had brought some meat , paprika garlic and some celery. After frying the  celery, we mixed it with the paprika and garlic and used it to add flavor to the meat. I stuffed meat into the casings while my sister cut the buns. We then set the sausages to cook in the oven for about thirty minutes. We sat recounting how our mother used to teach us how to cook when we were younger and how she always corrected us when we were wrong. After the sausages were cooked , we put them between the buns. Such a delicious lunch.",

On my walk to the shopping centre  I thought about all the things I would buy. Most of the things on my list were items I needed. A tooth brush, some bread, pencils, socks. I had clipped some coupons and knew I would save a few dollars so that I could get that new game I like. I couldn't wait to see it on the shelf and actually hold it in my hands. I arrived at the shopping centre. It wasn't very busy and I was glad of that. First I did all of my important shopping. And sure enough I had enough money for the game. I rushed to the electronics section and sunk in despair when I saw the shelf was empty. They were sold out of the game I had waited so long to play. The store clerk saw my disappointment and offered me a rain check for when they got more stock in. It would be about 2 weeks' but there was hope. I gathered my things and went home. I marked my calendar for when my next trip to the shopping centre would be... in two weeks. Now all I could do was wait... patiently of course!",

After dinner, I walked her to her apartment and she gave me her phone number and a good night kiss.  I was so happy!

The quest arrived at noon, many of them brought gifts. I wanted to get pictures of everyone. I got my camera out and asked everyone to gather together for a group photo. They stood very still with smiles on their faces. I brought the camera up to my face, looked through the view hole, and made sure I got everyone in the picture. I pushed the snapshot button and took the pictures. I took a couple of pictures of Jamie when he walked in and everyone yelled surprise. We ate cake and had a good time, then everyone went home. I took the film to the store and they printed out the pictures. I paid for the pictures and left the store. Now, Jamie will always have the pictures of his birthday surprise party.",

Gathering everything up I'll carry it across the sand till I find a nice spot down by the water.  Then ill set up my chair and umbrella, making sure to drive it deep into the sand so it doesn't blow away.  I'll make sure to put on sunscreen before I settle in my chair to sunbath for a while.  And when I am sweating and hot I'll run into the water and swim around to cool off.  While I dry off I'll have a sandwich and something to drink.  I like to listen to the waves crashing and the seagulls. I'll hang out and sun and swim until late in the afternoon before I go home.  Then Ill have to pack everything up, walk across the hot sand and back to my car.  I'll make sure to knock the sand off all my stuff before packing my car and driving home.",

I call up my favorite pizza place which is a general store downtown (I have the number memorized) and let them know I want a large fresh dough Hawaiian pizza with bacon and EXTRA pineapple. The lady on the phone tells me it will be ready in approximately 30 minutes, I thank her and hangup the phone. I make sure to note the time and I leave in about ten minutes even though it only takes seven minutes to drive there. I want to browse the store and buy some chips and soda too. While I'm looking at soda I see my favorite key lime pie flavored soda, it's expensive, but I don't care, because I deserve it. Before the full thirty minutes has passed I see the kitchen staff slide a large pizza box onto the counter clearly labeled \"Hawaiian\" I make my way to the counter with my chips and soda and proceed to pay the cashier using my debit card. I thank him and he tells me to \"have a nice day\" I respond with; \"I will now!\" and \"thank you sir\" I also turn to the lady who made my pizza and thank her too.",

Part of the proceeds for the purchase were going to plant more trees in town . The tree I had was some kind of evergreen tree and I planned to plant it in the front yard . I asked my Dad where it 'd be best to plant it and we picked a spot where there were some flowers , but no trees . In order to plant it I read the instructions that came with the tree and started by digging a hole that was about twice the size of the root ball of the tree . It was a small tree so this was not a big hole . I then tried to make the hole a good shape before putting in some moss and fill dirt . I watered the tree that day and made sure to water it each day for about a week until we had a good rain . The tree grew and became quite large . The one thing I did n't realize is that I should have planned better for how big the tree was going to get because it ended up shadowing over the flower planters a bit .",

Even though lyft and uber are unregulated and probably bad for the economy, drivers, and passengers, they are just so darn convenient. If you take a cab you have to call the cab company and let them know where you want to be picked up. They then send a driver to you. They're supposed to have credit card machines in the cab but often they don't. This means you need to have cash with you. For the fare as well as a tip. So I call a cab and I ask it to take me to the French Quarter. The cab driver says okay and takes the longest route possible so he gets more money. We make inane small talk as he drives until it gets too awkward and then we sit in silence. When we arrive at the destination I overpay him for the ride.",

I went back to the cutting board and held the onion to the board.  I cut the top and bottom off of the onion and sliced the skin off.  Then I threw those away.  After that, I took the onion and cut it in half.  I started to chop the onion into pieces.  I did the same with the bell pepper.  The carrots and celery were much easier.  I only had to chop little chunks off the ends as I slid the vegetable down the board.  Once all of them were chopped, I threw them in the pot.",

I needed to bring the right clothes for the weather as well as the activities I would do. I also needed to pack things I need if the weather changes. I folded up several sweaters, as small as I could, as well as a few pairs of pants. I folded my tee shirts and paired my socks. Once I had it all folded and ready, I placed the clothes in the suitcase. I doubled check to make sure it would all fit well. I also packed my tooth and hairbrush on the outside pockets.",

I had to sign in with the front desk, designate my parking place and give my license plate before the door man would let me in the building. I cross the lobby and head upstairs. As I enter the apartment, I see the fish tank. They look happy and very active. The sun is shining in through a window across the room and there is a table next to the tank with a container of fish food. I read the container to make sure I understand the instruction. Thomas said to give the fish two nice size pinches of food. You can't give them too much or it will sink and make the water murky. I try to get just the right amount. The fish get really active when they notice food and immediately start eating. Fish are so easy.",

I walked around the room, picking up toys. I tried to pick up a couple similar ones at a time, because I would have to put them in the same place.  I picked up all the LEGO pieces off the floor.  I had started building a spaceship but had not had time to finish.  I put all the pieces together in a bag so that they would be together when I wanted to finish building the spaceship.  I put my brother's action figures back up on the shelf where they belonged.  My mom said I could have a popsicle for doing a good job.",

First, I checked to see what kind of batteries it used. It uses one 9 volt battery. Next, I checked to see if I had any 9 volt batteries in the house. I did not, so I knew I had to go to the store. I walked to the store and bought a pack of 9 volt batteries, and returned home. Then, I went to the alarm clock and opened the battery compartment. I took out the old battery and threw it away. Then I took a new battery out of the pack I just bought. I put it in the battery compartment and closed the compartment. Then I checked to see if the numbers were lit up. Then it was time to set the time. I checked my watch for the correct time and pushed the buttons to make the alarm clock the right time. Finally, I set the alarm time to the time I usually wake up and set the alarm for the next day.",

I will go in and turn on the hot water and while its heating up I will put down a bathmat outside the tub and get my towels.  I will use my hand to check the temperature, and turn on the cold water and to keep the water from getting to hot.  Once its a good temperature I take off my clothes and get in.  I stick my head under the water and get my hair wet and then wash it first with shampoo and then I use the conditioner.  Once I rinse the conditioner out, I was my face with a special face wash.  I like ones that smell like coconut.  I also use a coconut soap for my body and I wash myself down to my toes.  I'll then stand under the water for a few minutes till all the soap has rinsed out, and also cause it feels good.  I keep a waterproof clock in my shower so I don't waste to much hot water standing there for too long so I'll get out after 10 minutes.  I'll stand in the shower and towel off and go get ready for bed.",

After driving around for 5 minutes, we finally found a parking spot right. When we got to the line, we waited another 10 minutes to get our tickets. Since the Superman movie was in 3D we had to pay extra for our movie tickets. As we were walking to hand in our tickets to the ticket taker, he handed us our 3D glasses to use during the show. Before we walked into our theater, we ordered popcorn, a box of candy, and a large Pepsi. We had to sit in the front row since it was so crowded. After the movie was over, we threw away our 3D glasses into the recycle bin and headed home.",

I grabbed my tea kettle and dumped out all the water that was sitting in there and replaced it with fresh cool water. I placed the full kettle on the stove and turned on the burner to the highest setting to boil the water. While the kettle was warming I took out my teas and tea pot. I decided to have green tea that day, and scooped about 5 teaspoons of tea into the pot. Once the kettle was steaming, I turned off the stove and let it cool down a little. I poured the water in the pot and replaced the lid of the pot. When the tea was done steeping, I poured myself a cup into a tea cup that I had warmed up with some of the excess hot water. I poured in some sugar with a spoon and gave it a stir. Then I enjoyed my tea when it was cool enough to drink.",

The family heads home and everyone helps in taking down pictures and posters and any other decorations from the wall.  Dad uses water and a scrub brush to remove the old wallpaper. Everyone helps to clean and dry the walls after the old wallpaper is all gone. When the wall is dry it is time to put the new wallpaper up. The back of the new wallpaper has to be wet, but only a little bit. A small amount of water is applied to the back of the paper and then it is time to carefully place the new wallpaper on the wall. Dad uses a step-ladder to reach the high parts of the wall. Mom and dad use scissors to cut some of the paper to fit around electric outlets and windows. After the wallpaper is applied it needs to dry. The family waits for two or three hours then everyone admires the new wallpaper design and puts picture and posters back up on the wall.",

                "text": "In our house, we have a guest room that must not have been touched since the 1970's. It is carpeted in tasteless, dirty and old carpet that is begging to be changed. After considering several options, my wife and I decided to rip the carpet up and install some wood laminate flooring. We picked a day on the weekend and invited her father over to help us with the process. First we ripped the old carpeting up and prepared the bare surface to accept the new flooring. We had the flooring ordered and delivered the day previously, so I spent that night measuring and cutting the pieces to size. After the floor was properly prepped, we began laying each piece of laminate one by one. A few spots did not fit quite as planned so it became necessary to cut some pieces shorter than I had initially. Once we finished we took a long break and ordered pizza for dinner.",

I find a parking spot and get out of the car.  I walk into the store and get a grocery cart.  As I walk into the store, I grab a sale flyer and look at the store's sales and specials.  Next, I start going down the aisles at the store, adding things into my cart that are on my list or are on sale and would be appreciated at my house.  After I am done shopping, I get in line to check out.  I wait patiently for my turn.  When it's finally my turn, I check out and pay for my items.

When we get the bills, we put them in a nice pile to make sure that we don't lose or forget about any of them.  Once or twice a month, we will sit down and make sure that we pay the bills.  Sometimes we use our computers or phones to log into accounts and pay the bills.  The money comes out of our bank account and we always check to make sure that we have enough of it.  We often will talk about what we can do in the next weeks to make sure that we don't have too many bills to pay.",

When we arrived we found an empty spot and put our towels down, along with the items we brought for the day which included some snacks, suntan lotion, books, drinks, and a change of clothes. There were many people there, including lots of children with their parents and some adults alone or with friends. Shortly after we arrived, we put on suntan lotion and took a dip in the pool. It was just the right temperature. Cool, but not too cold. We swam around for a bit and then got out and laid on our towels for a while. We relaxed in the sun and had a nice chat about what was going on in our lives while we ate some snacks. I then took out my book and began to read while my friend relaxed with her eyes closed for a while. I eventually became tired of reading and went in a dip in the pool by myself for a bit. After a few hours of swimming and relaxing in the sun, it was starting to get late so we decided to head home. We put some warm clothes on in the changing room and headed home for the day.",

One of the places we like to go to has a machine full of movies called Redbox. We go to this store, and use the machine to rent movies.  When you go up to the Redbox machine, you just press \"Rent Movies\",  and then it shows you movies you may like.  They even have categories you can pick from, like comedy, drama, suspense, and even scary ones.  Usually, my friends and I pick comedy movies when we watch movies together.  So, once you pick a movie, then you press that button for the movie, and it let's you use your bank card to pay for the movie.  The machine records your card information from your bank, so that whenever you bring it back, it will charge you for how many days you kept it.  It is very cheap to use, and very nice.",

We got ready for the flight one day before by packing all of our belongings that we would be taking in suitcases. The airport we would be using was just a half hour away from our house, so the drive wasn't long. Once we arrived at the airport, we had to step through the metal detectors and go through security so that the airport knew we didn't have any weapons or anything illegal. After security, we went to get our plane tickets, and waited until our flight was ready for boarding. We then gave up all of our baggage so that it could be put on the plane, and we got on the plane.",

After that, we let the egg stay in the hot pan for around 5 minutes, adding cheese as necessary. As we watched the egg form and stirred it, we started to turn the stove off. Soon after, the omelette was done and we placed it onto a plate with a fork. After this, we began to eat and we enjoyed the amazing cheese filled omelette that we made.",

My friends and I couldn't agree on which toppings we wanted, so we decided to get one pizza that was half cheese, half pepperoni, and another pizza that was half veggie, half sausage. We looked up the phone number to our nearby pizza place by searching the Internet. We then put a call in and spoke with the hostess, who took our order. She said that the pizza would be ready for pickup in about thirty minutes. We asked if the pizza place offered delivery, and she said yes, but there would be an additional $5 charge. We agreed to pay for the delivery. She told us the total for our bill, and we provided our credit card information and then hung up the phone. Thirty minutes later, we picked up the pizza to take back home.",

We would ask our parents if could go to the pool at the gym on the same afternoon, so that we could play together.  Usually, that meant that we would go on Saturdays or Sundays, when our parents were home in the afternoons.  Tommy was a great swimmer, and he taught Jessie and I how to swim and do the back stroke, and even the butterfly stroke.  I was the best at floating, and I always would beat Tommy and Jessie at that game.  I could float better than them both!  I would get on my back and float on top of the water very easily. It was fun!  Jessie had a hard time floating, so she used her floats to help her stay up.  Sometimes her mom brought the large floats we could all get on at once.  We loved those!  We would play horse on them, and also try to knock each other off the floats!",

They each write checks for the bills, and then David writes a check for the rent on their apartment. They check each bill one last time, then seal up the envelopes and put stamps on them.

We get in the house and decide who should go to shower first. We go to our rooms and peel off all the sticky and yucky clothes and gather our clean clothes and underwear. My sister goes first. She turns on the faucet and sets the water at a temperature that is not too warm or cool. We both know to step in carefully, get our wash clothes and soap. A fresh shower with shower and water we know will wash away all the grime from our bodies and hair. We made sure we had clean towels to dry off.  Stepping out of the shower and being clean and fresh really feels good after a long day of play.",

I went to Target to purchase wrapping paper and then when I came home, I arranged the scissors and tape together so  that I would be ready to complete this task. I then set the gift wrap on the floor and placed by gift around it. Upon doing this, I started to cut the wrap in a manner that fit the gift, leaving some extra. I had a little trouble, but was able to wrap the gift successfully and give the gift. I felt that having extra wrapping paper and the supplies ready and accessible worked to my advantage and helped me complete this task quickly and efficiently. This was a great experience.",

I was hoping to find a high end seafood restaurant that had availability for us at short notice.  I searched yelp until I found a place that I thought would be absolutely perfect.  The restaurant is called Grill 23.  I thought for sure that they would be booked but I decided to try and book it anyway.  I accessed Open Table on line and submitted my request for Grill 23 at 7:00 on Saturday night.  Unfortunately they were booked so I had to make our reservation for 9:00 instead.  On Saturday my friend and I spent the day touring and shopping around the city.  By the time it was time for our reservation we were very hungry.  We went to Grill 23 and ended up having an amazing dinner.  It was definitely worth the wait.",

I used a dustpan to collect all the debris, placing it on the floor and using the broom to sweep all of the brie onto the surface of the dustpan. I empty the contents of the dustpan into the garbage then placed the broom and dust pan into the corner. I then made a bucket of water that had floor cleaning solution diluted into it in order to make sites. I took my mop from the corner of the room where the room was, and placed the head of the mob into the water, soaking the head of the mop. Once the head of the mop was completely submerged underwater, and soaking wet, I removed the mop from the bucket and squeeze out the excess water. I then use the mop to wipe over the entire floor. I ensure that all of the stains and stuck on dirt that was on the floor have been removed with the mop, and that the floor looks spotless including when I finished. I rinsed off the mop with clean water, to remove the left over grime and dirt, and placed the mop in the corner. I also emptied the dirty mop water from the bucket, and placed the empty bucket in the corner as well. I then left the room so that the floor could completely dry before I stepped on it again.",

I put my bookmark into my book, and got up out of bed and went to the light switch to turn on the overhead light so I wasn't in the dark anymore.  I keep spare light bulbs in my pantry and found the one with the right wattage to replace the broken one.  Once back at the lamp I made sure to switch it off and unplug in.  I removed the shade and saw I must have had the light bulb in for a long time because it was a little dark on one side.  I twisted the light bulb up and out and held it to my ear and shook it like a maraca.  The broken coils bounced around inside and it sound like a rattle.  I took the new light bulb and screwed it in, making sure not to over tighten it so it was seated perfectly.  I put the lamp shade back on, plugged it back in and flipped its switch.  The lamp worked just like new.  I put the old light bulb in the garbage before heading back to bed to keep reading.",

We each paid for our visit and included a towel in the purchase. Then we entered the sauna. It was very warm and humid, just like we expected. It was very relaxing. We talked a little bit but mostly we just sat in silence and enjoyed the atmosphere. It was a wooden structure that felt very rustic. Eventually we started to get overheated, and my friend suggested we leave. We got up and exited the sauna. We thanked the workers at the front desk for our visit and then we went on with our day.",

I scanned my ticket, then went through the turnstile. I followed the signs to the correct platform and waited a few minutes to for the train to arrive.

It still had cartoony race car trim up and the carpet had seen better days. It's always best to start off with a plan so we sat down a talked about how we wanted the room to look. It is still our son's room when he needs to visit from college so it couldn't be entirely out of his taste. A whiteboard was set up and we made notes about what the room could be after our son finally does move out. An office was the winning choice. We packed everything our son left in the room into boxes and stacked those in the living room. Since DIY isn't really part of our skill set, we shopped around for contractors to help us. They stripped the carpet and trim from the empty room. The painter changed the wall to a warm light grey. When the paint had dried we called a contractor in to put down a nice maroon carpet. The furniture was put back into the room. Afterwards we decided to go through the boxes and only put back the things we were sure our son was keeping. Everything else was left in a box and put in the garage so that our son could look through it when he returned and hopefully throw out some of the junky items.",

To begin this process, I made a to-do list for the day. I wrote the items down in order from highest priority to lowest priority. Then I got to work. I fed the animals (one dog and two cats), took out the garbage, did the dishes, and cleaned the cat's litter box. My next step was to start cooking breakfast. I fried the eggs, cooked the bacon, fried the hash browns, and cooked the toast. After my spouse and I ate, I had a few more dishes to do. After finishing up those dishes, I put a load of laundry into the washer. After about an hour or so, the clothes were done washing and they were ready to be put in the dryer. After the clothes were dried and folded, I was officially done with my chores. I could finally relax!",

I then lifted the phone to my ear and said \"Hello, Sister!\" in a pleasant voice.  My sister was calling to discuss the details of our upcoming family vacation this summer.  I confirmed that I agreed with her hotel selections for our vacation.  We chatted for a while, and then she indicated that she had go to an appointment downtown.  I told her that I was glad to have had a chance to have spoken with her, and that I would speak to her again soon.  I pressed the button to end the call and hung up the phone.",

Then, I mixed up the filling for the lasagna. The filling contained ricotta cheese, one egg, mozzarella cheese, parmesan cheese, spinach, and salt and pepper. Then I got a glass casserole dish from my cupboard and coated it with cooking spray so that the food would not stick to it. I then put a layer of tomato sauce on the bottom of the dish. Next I put the dry lasagna noodles and a layer of the cheese mixture I made. I then repeated these steps until the dish was full. I put extra mozzarella cheese on top. I poured a cup of water around the edges of the dish so that the noodles would soak up this liquid while they cooked. I then put the dish in the oven and set a timer for one hour. When the timer went off, I checked on the lasagna. It was ready. My partner and I ate it for dinner and it was delicious.",

First, I decided what meals I would make during the week and thought about all of the ingredients I would need to prepare the meals. I looked in my fridge and pantry to see what ingredient I was missing. I made sure to write these missing items down on my list. I also looked at commonly used items, such as milk, bread, and eggs to make sure that I had them. I wrote down anything that was almost gone or completely gone. I then wrote down any household items that I needed, like paper towels and laundry soap. I also thought ahead about any supplies I would need for the upcoming week. I am planning to have friend over this weekend for a cookout, and needed paper plates. I included these on my list. After finishing my list, I read through it and double checked it before taking it with me to the grocery store.",

She said she would call my landline phone at home. I waited around the house for her call, listening intently for the ring of the telephone. At around 3:30 in the afternoon, I heard the phone ring. I was upstairs when the phone started ringing, and had to run downstairs to get the phone before the call would get to voicemail. I answered the phone a bit breathlessly by saying, \"Hello, this is Kathryn.\" My friend responded that it was her. I greeted her enthusiastically and asked how she was doing. We ended up chatting for thirty minutes, and it was a great conversation! It was fun to catch up with my friend on the phone. After our call, I hung up.",

I like to sit at the sushi bar because it is easier to get good service, but the restaurant was very busy, so I had to sit at a table instead of at the sushi bar. A waitress came to take my order. I ordered a spicy tuna roll and the waitress said my order would be ready in about ten minutes. When the waitress brought my order, she didn't bring be a spicy tuna roll, but instead she brought me a California roll. I told the waitress she brought me the wrong order, so I had her take it back.  After about ten more minutes, the waitress came back and apologized for bringing me the wrong order, and she gave me the spicy tuna roll I ordered. The waitress felt so bad she offered to pay for my sushi.",

He pulled up the carpet and got rid of it and made sure the floor was okay. It was fine to work with so he got the padding for the room out of his truck and brought it into the living room. He padded down the floor with his friends. He put it down across the entire room and proceeded to get the carpet out of his truck now.

When the appointment came around, I walked in to the reception area. I told the lady behind the desk who I was. She asked to see my medical card, and I gave it to her promptly. Then she gave me a form to fill out while I waited. Finally, a nurse came out and called my name. I went with her through a door to a large hallway. She took my height and weight. Then she led me to a private room. She took my blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and asked why I was there that day. After she was done, she left me in the room alone. I waited. The doctor came and asked me similar questions. He determined I had an ear infection. I left the doctor's office with a prescription for antibiotics. I knew it would make me feel much better!",

During the week, we are rushing out of the house, and my husband and I are lucky if we have time to shovel a cereal bar down our throats before we leave the house. We walked down stairs, and I began preparing breakfast for my husband and I. I decided on eggs and bacon for this Saturday's breakfast. I crack the eggs on the side of the bowl, drop them in the bowl, and begin whisking away. I always make sure to add a little bit of milk to make the eggs fluffier. I drop them in the pan and listen as they sizzle away. As they cook, I fry up some bacon in a hot pan. I prefer my bacon crispy, as my husband prefers his bacon a bit more tender. When the meal is done cooking, I put it on a plate and we sit down to eat. We take our time and really savor every bits. I love lazy Saturdays.",

I put the big sectional into my dinning room table and went to my closest to get my best table cloth to put over my table. After I covered it just right I brought out my finest china from my cabinet and started to spread the dishes out at each of the seats. I placed each plate in its spot complete with forks, knives, and spoons. Next thing I had to do was get my crystal glasses out so I could put one by each of the plates and fill them with water for my guests. After my friends had arrived and I served them we raised our glasses in a toast to or relationships. We had a lovely meal and they stayed to help me clear the table and put back all the dishes were they belonged.",

We looked through possible things to do in the area, and decided on dancing at a swing dancing club.  We got dressed in some nice, but easy to move in clothes, got in the car, and drove to the club.  We had a couple of drinks at the bar while watching the others dance on the dance floor  before joining them ourselves.  When we got on the floor, we danced together, doing spins and dips in time with the music coming from the stage.  We would take breaks in between some songs to cool off and get drinks, before heading back out for more dancing.  Eventually, there was a dancing competition, and we lasted for two rounds before getting eliminated, but we didn't mind, since we had a great time.  We then went home.",

The last time we decided to play a movie, my husband went to the \"on demand\" feature on our TV and scrolled through all the \"new release\" movies that were available. We both saw a few movies that we wanted to watch, but we didn't want to watch all of the same movies, so we needed to decide on one. We finally decided to watch a movie we both agreed on. He pressed \"buy\" on the remote and the movie started playing. We both watched the movie in quiet without any one disturbing us. It was really nice. I look forward to having those movie days with my husband since they are few and far between these days.",

After this, I got to pick my theme! Of course, I chose my favorite movie, Ghostbusters! We went to the party store and got decorations and invitations. Mom looked up my friends' addresses. I helped her fill out the invitations and I even put the stamps on the envelope. After we filled out all of the invitations and addressed the envelopes, we walked to the post office. Mom had to help me put them in the box because I couldn't reach. I am so excited for my party!",

I also put a dash of salt into the water, since this is supposed to help it boil more quickly. While this heated, I grabbed a box of dry pasta and measured out the amount that I wanted into another container. I poured the pasta into the water once it was boiling. I allowed the pasta to boil for 8 minutes, according to the directions of the pasta box. I set a timer to prevent overcooking. One the timer went off, I stopped it, turned off the burner, and put on oven mitts. I also placed a colander into the sink. While wearing the oven mitts, I poured the pasta and water into the colander. I then removed the colander from the sink and placed the pasta into a bowl so that it was ready to have sauce added to it.",

I sat in the waiting room and watched the television a while. Soon, a woman came and led me back to a small room with a big padded chair. She had me sit in the chair, and tucked a sort of paper napkin around my neck. Then the dentist came in and smiled and said hi. She asked how I was feeling, and I said I was fine. She told me she was just going to look at my teeth, and she did. She pushed a button and the chair whirred and slowly tilted back. I opened wide, and she looked at my teeth one by one, using a small round mirror on a thin metal stick to see them. She said everything looked good, and I should keep brushing and flossing. I told her I would. She was nice, and I'll see her again in six months.",

My first question was if I should stay in a hotel or with friends.  Due to the cost of hotels I decided that staying with friends was the very best option.  I then decided that to travel to New York City my best choice would be to take the train.  The train trip from Boston to New York City is relatively short and it's very convenient because the train stop is very close to my friends apartment.  My friends and I then decided that we should make dinner reservations for a nice new years dinner in New York.  I took care of the reservations for dinner and the train and now I am just waiting a couple of months so I can take this really exciting trip.",

I decided since I was so hungry already and did not want to wait long I would use the microwave method. I opened up the package and took out a hot dog. Placing it on a paper towel I set the cook time for 20 seconds. It was ready then but very hot. I took out a bun and then spread some mustard, relish and ketchup on it as well. I then placed the hot dog in the bun and eat it all.  It was very tasty and satisfied my hunger.",

I wash my arms, my legs, my back, and my feet. I make sure my entire body is nicely soaped up and cleaned, then I rinse all the soap off. Then, I wash my hair by getting it wet and adding shampoo and conditioner. Once I'm all rinsed off, I'm done showering. I get out of the shower and take my towel to dry myself off. I put on some deodorant, to make sure I keep smelling fresh for the rest of the day. Once I'm all washed up, I get dressed and I'm ready to face my day!",

                "text": "As I walked around the house, gathering up all the dirty clothes sometimes smelling them if I was unsure of their dirtiness. Then I separated colors. Sorting whites from colored clothing. Jeans from the more delicate ones. Starting with a load of white as they are usually smaller I start the water before pouring in just a cap full of bleach. Once that load has finished I move it to the dryer, with a dryer sheet to help soften and scent the clothes. Then I place the other clothes in the washer and pour in the measured amount of laundry detergent. It goes through a wash and then a rinse cycle before they are ready for the dryer. I take the whites out the dryer so I can move the next load in. Again a dryer sheet is placed. This also helps remove lint. Check the lint trap clean it if necessary and start drying that load!",

I had to get a tape measure and measure all four walls. I had to measure how high they were and how wide they were. Then there was this formula where you multiplied the height times the width, divided that by 144 . . . and that's as far as I got. Wallpaper isn't that expensive and I didn't mind having some left over.  So, I just made a guess when I picked out my wallpaper. I can always get more if I need it. I finally got everything out of my bedroom. Other than my bed, the room was totally empty. Then I made a table out of two saw-horses and a board. I opened the package and unrolled a sheet of wallpaper on the table. I peeled the backing off, climbed the ladder, aligned it with the ceiling and affixed it to the wall.",

I ran upstairs to hold and coddle her, and realized she wasn't being soothed. I knew she didn't need a diaper change as I had just changed her before her nap and her diaper felt dry. I realized she must be hungry. I brought her back downstairs and opened the fridge to get out a bottle of milk. I brought her and the bottle to the couch, sat her on my lap, and brought the nipple of the bottle to her lips. The baby suckled onto the bottle and I could hear her sucking in the milk. After a few minutes, she released her lips from the nipple, indicating to me that she had had enough to eat. I set the bottle down and placed the baby over my shoulder to burp her.",

I put my dirty laundry and my dirty bed sheets in the washing machine and added laundry detergent to it. I then set my machine to the correct settings and pressed the button to start the laundry. Now I needed some clean sheets on my bed, so I went to my closet when I keep the clean bedding. I found a clean sheet and carried it back to my bedroom. I unfolded the sheet and matched up the corners of the sheet with the corners of my bed. I laid the sheet on my bed and tucked in the sides of the sheet that were hanging over my bed. Then I put my blanket and pillows back on the bed. Now I had clean sheets!",

Seeing his wife looking slightly sad, Aaron walked over and hugged her. They stared at the mess together for a few minutes and laughed together. The kids came running back to the car with the various toys and games that a three and five year old needed. Regina asked Aaron to check that everything they had packed was strapped down. As he went to do that, she buckled her little boys in. Then got out her list from the glove box. She went to the back of the car and started checking off things she could see. The grill; check, the kids suitcases; check, her and Aaron's suitcases; check, the bikes; check, propane; check, extra camping odds and ends; check, and her wonderful and adoring family; double check. She smiled as she put the list away and Aaron started the car. They happily sped off on their week away at Yellowstone National Park.",

So I took the battery cover off of the bottom of the alarm clock, which is where I saw the the two dead AA batteries. I took the batteries out, one by one, and through the old batteries in the garbage. I then opened a brand-new store-bought pack of AA batteries, and removed two of them from the packaging. Following the direct actions within the battery compartment of the alarm clock, I inserted each of the batteries one by one, ensuring that the positive and negative terminals were facing in the correct directions. Once both batteries were in place and snugly intact, I put the battery cover back on the bottom of the alarm clock in order to secure the batteries in place. I then turned over the clock so that it was sitting right side up and facing me. I push the power button and the face of the clock lit up, with 12 o'clock blinking in red.",

First, I went into the kitchen and took out my tea kettle.  I filled it with water and put it on the stove.  I turned on the stove and let the kettle warm.  While the water inside the kettle was getting hot, I looked through my cupboard and pulled out my box of tea bags. I looked through my choices and decided on a peppermint tea.  I then got out a tea cup and put the bag in the cup.  After several minutes my tea kettle started to whistle, signally that the water was hot enough. I carefully took the tea kettle off of the stove, being cautious not to burn myself.  I slowly poured the water into the tea cup and let the bag soak in the hot water.  Afterwards, I took my tea cup out to the deck and sat down with my favorite book.",

One of the first things that we did to clean was to get out the vacuum.  To do so, I opened up the door to the closet and got it out of there.  I took the plug and put it in a socket that was close to the area of the floor that I wanted to clean.  I hit the power button and the vacuum started to make a weird noise.  I opened the vacuum up and cleaned the inside out.  After that, it was ready to get started.  I pushed the vacuum all over the floor in every part of the house.  It was very loud and it was nice to push the power button and turn it off when I was finished.",

I bought several pounds because my daughter loves fresh strawberries . I finished up in the produce section , buying some things to make a green salad later to go with dinner . I then stopped at the meat section and picked out some nice cuts of steak for dinner . I went into the frozen foods section and found ice cream was also on sale . I bought vanilla and chocolate . I went through the rest of the aisles , consulting my list and picking out what my family needed . When I had found everything I needed , and put them in my cart , I walked over to the checkout lanes . I stood in line and waited for my turn . Finally , it was my turn and the checkout person checked me out . I paid my bill , and walked out to my car with the shopping cart . Then I loaded the car up with the groceries , returned the cart and drove home .",

I cracked a couple of eggs into a glass bowl and added some seasoning.  I also added a little milk to give it some fluffiness.  Then I whipped up and stirred the eggs.  While I was stirring the eggs, I set a pan on the stove and heated a pat of butter.  When it was hot enough, I poured the eggs into the pan.  As the eggs started to cook, I flipped them and cooked them on the other side.  I put a bit of shredded cheese and diced ham on the egg and flipped it over in half.  I turned the heat down and let the egg cool off a bit.  After a minute or two, I slid the omelette off onto a plate.  It was so very delicious!",

My father gave an idea to gather my friends and watch some good movie and he promised to help in playing the movie. I invited some of my interested friends to watch the movie. We discussed and decided to watch the animation movie 'Up'. I went to the shop along with my father to buy the DVD for the movie 'Up'. My father taught me to connect the DVD player to our television. Once the player is connected, I had to insert the disc in the player through the proper hole. Once the disc is placed, I had to switch on the play button to get the movie played. After the movie is finished we have to push the stop button and get the disc out of the player. I learned everything well from my father and played the movie once our friends gathered. We all enjoyed the movie well.",

We then looked online for invitations and found a great selection. We let our daughter pick her favorite and ordered 30 of them. When the invitations came we filled out the names for each then addressed the envelopes with only names so that she could hand the invitations out at school. Each invitation explained what the party was for, when it would be, and what to bring and expect. She took the invitations to school the next day and handed them to all of her friends, barely able to contain her excitement. The party was a hit.",

Once home, I picked up the clock and used a Phillips head screwdriver to open the back of the clock. Using my finger nail I pulled on each of the two batteries from one side until they came loose. I put the dead batteries in the used battery drawer for recycling at a later date. I grabbed two fresh batteries from the adjacent drawer. I popped the batteries, making sure the positive and negatives were properly aligned and I screwed the plate back on with the screwdriver. I had to reset the time which wasn't hard, I just turned the dial on the back until it was correct. I then reset the alarm as well so that I would not be late from oversleeping the next day as well.",

Because, of the existing color the walls will need to be primed before painting. Max fills the painting pan and uses the roller to prime the walls. Using the roller was tough, so Max used the sprayer machine to paint the walls. Hum, hum, hum the machine sprayed forcefully a thin layer of paint, in all there were three layers of paint. The sprayer made the job much easier, and Max was very pleased with the color pale yellow. The walls dried over night and Max uncovered the furniture and updated the room with new pictures, curtains and accessories. Max was very happy with the end results.",

I  was looking for something to do and I knew that neither of us had seen a movie in a long time. As a result, I found a DVD and we watched it. I had to go downstairs to find a comedy movie that would be enjoyable to both of us, since that was the type of movie that we wanted to watch. Once I found the movie, I put it into the DVD player and started to watch. We both relaxed and watching the movie. Later, I had to turn the volume up because we were having trouble seeing. Since we got tired about half way through the movie, I had to set the sleep timer on the TV so that it would not remain on all night. However, we did end up staying awake throughout the duration of the movie.",

I checked through my camping box to make sure I had camp stove fuel, batteries for the flashlights, camp utensils, bug spray and everything else I might need. I also double checked to make sure all the stakes and poles were with my tent. Lastly I loaded up a cooler with food and snacks. I rounded up the kids and we got into the car. We drove half an hour away on the highway before turning onto a Forest Service Road. After about 15 minutes we pulled into a campground. We selected a spot, looking for one that was well shaded and set back from the road. The kids took the tent out and began putting poles together. I helped them stake out the tent. Then we gathered up firewood together and placed it in the fire ring. I got some matches from the box and lit some of the smaller twigs. I poked around the fire until it began to burn well and then started to get out some food for dinner.",

I confirmed with him that the dates were OK and started looking at airfare. The best prices I could find consisted of two layovers and included an overnight flight but I was willing to suffer a little bit to save a few hundred dollars. After I booked my flight I gave my Dad the information and he said he would schedule some days off to spend with me. I did some research on things I would like to do in Maui and decided I wanted to go whale watching and possibly snorkeling if the weather was nice. Dad made the reservations since he gets a discount as a resident. I also found some restaurants that I wanted to try. I thought about if I needed to buy anything before I went and decided to pack light and purchase essentials there to not risk my bag getting lost. The trip went as planned and was very relaxing and beautiful.",

In order to make a chopped salad, I knew that I would need to chop vegetables. First, I decided which vegetables I wanted to chop. I decided that I wanted carrots, tomatoes, cucumbers, and iceberg lettuce in my salad. I carefully washed the vegetables to remove any dirt or sand that might have gotten on them. I then got out my wooden cutting board and my chopping knife, which is sharp enough to easily slice through hard foods like cucumbers. I placed the washed vegetables on the chopping board and carefully chopped up the vegetables, one by one. I tried to chop the vegetables so that they were of similar sizes and shapes. I then put all of the chopped vegetables into a mixing bowl and used a mixing spoon to stir them together.",

My wife and I cook a large meal with plenty of food for everyone. We all sit at the table and eat and talk and laugh and have a really nice time. Once dinner is over we begin to clean up. We gather up all of the dirty dishes and silverware and rinse them off in the sink and then put them in the dishwasher. After the table is cleared off it needs to be cleaned. So I gather together a clean, dry rag and some kitchen cleaner, and spray the cleaner on the table. I make sure to spray all the sticky spots because they can be harder to clean off. I then take my rag and wipe it over the table, over and over again until the table is dry and completely clean. The table becomes so shiny and bright that it looks brand new. I then put the cleaner away and place the cleaning rag in the washing machine. After this I wash my hands thoroughly and then move on to whatever else is left to do.",

I had already put the steak in the oven and was about to begin saut\u00e9ing the vegetables. I pulled a zucchini and a yellow squash out of the refrigerator and placed them on my cutting board. I grabbed a knife from our knife block and began to cut the vegetables. I first cut them into equal sized rounds, but those would be too big to bite so I decided to cut them again. I cut each round in half so it was in the shape of a semicircle. All of my vegetables were cut, but I decided to put one more vegetable in with the mix. I pulled some grape tomatoes out of the refrigerator and put about ten of them on my cutting board. I cut them all in half and poured them into the pan along with my yellow squash and zucchini.",

I peeled one side of the band aid sticky cover off, one sticky side exposed,  I stuck it on bare skin just to the side of the wound. I then peeled off the other side and gently pressed the band-aid to my skin, making sure the wound was centered and properly covered by the pad part of the band aid. I tried my best not to get the wounded are and band aid damp over the next few days. I also reapplied a bandage at least once a day for 3 days until the wound stayed closed on its own.",

The first thing to do is wash the cut. I have to wash away the blood and whatever dirt that may have gotten into the wound. Then, I apply disinfectant. If I don't apply the disinfectant, the germs that are already in the cut could cause an infection, and that could make me very sick. Finally, it's time to put on a bandage. I take a bandage from the box, unwrap it, and stick it right over my wound. It's very important to wrap the bandage tightly, so it stays stuck on my skin. When the bandage gets old and dirty, I carefully take it off and put a fresh one on, applying more disinfectant so I don't get sick. Soon enough, my cut has healed!",

As I opened the mailbox I saw that it was full, so I grabbed all the letters and mail with two hands. I walked back towards the front door and went inside my house to open the letters I received in the mail. I opened the first letter, then the second, by the third letter I must have gotten distracted and ripped the envelope to quickly. That's when I felt the edge of the paper rip into my finger. Automatically, I reacted and dropped the letter on the table and saw the slit on my finger in which it started to bleed. I headed to the bathroom and in the medicine cabinet I pulled out the first aid kit. I rinsed my finger under warm water and disinfected it with alcohol. Then I patted dry my finger and opened an medium sized band aid to place it on my finger. I peeled the backing on the band aid and place it over the small cut on my finger. I wrapped my finger with the band aid and clean up. Then I headed back to open the rest of my mail.",

First, I had to go into the bathroom and get the package of band aids out of the medicine cabinet above the sink. I took a band aid out of the box and removed the paper wrapper that keeps it clean and sterile. I set it off to the side, then turned on the water in the sink and adjusted the temperature until it was warm. Next, I washed my cut to make sure it was clean, then I dried my hands on the towel hanging above the toilet. I took the band aid and gently placed it over the cut, taking care to make sure that the adhesive stuck to my skin so the band aid wouldn't fall off. Finally, I threw away the paper wrapper that the band aid came in, and left the bathroom to finish my day.",

I needed to wash the cut and put on a band aid, so it would not get anything dirty in the cut. I went to the medicine cabinet and got out the box of band aids. I also got a bottle of wound wash, peroxide. I held the finger I cut over the sink, and poured the peroxide over the wound. It stung a little, but I did it so I knew my cut was clean. I let the peroxide fizzle then dry for a moment. Once it was dry, I opened the band aid. I had to removed it from the box, then the paper it was wrapped in, the take the pieces of wax paper off the sticky parts. Once I did I held my finger out and used my other hand to put the soft part on the cut. I wrapped the band aid around my finger and picked up all the papers that were on it.",

                "text": "I have a problem with picking scabs off of my skin. One of the only ways I can combat this is to apply a band aid over the areas to prevent myself from picking at them. To put on the band aid, I open the wrapper and then take off the two little pieces of glossy paper protecting the sticky adhesive side. I then place the band aid over the spot that I either picked already or want to prevent myself from picking. Once i do that, I throw away all the band aid remnants. The band aid itself is a peach, off-white sort of color -- I hesitate to say \"nude\" because that implies that everyone has the same skin tone, which is untrue. I usually leave the band aid on for as long as possible, which typically ends up being until I shower next. Sometimes I will use small circle band aids if I do not have a full band aid available.",

That kitten did not like to have his tail pulled and he scratched Lucy right on her arm.  Poor Lucy, she had a bad scrape and she needed a band aid.  She asked her mother to help her.  They got the band aid out of the box and carefully unwrapped it.  Then Lucy's mother gently cleaned her scrape and applied a little bit of ointment.  They peeled the paper off the back of the band aid and gently applied it to the scrape.  Lucy knew that it was important to keep the band aid on for a few days until the scrape started to heal.  After the band aid was on and she got a hug from her mother Lucy felt so much better!",

I went into my bathroom and carefully washed my knee with soap and water. I pat the area dry with a towel. I knew it would be very important to keep the area clean so it would not get infected. Therefore, I applied the antibiotic ointment I keep in my bathroom drawer to the scrape on my knee. I used a cotton swab instead of my fingers, so I wouldn't get the sticky ointment everywhere. I then decided to put a band aid on, to help keep germs out. I tore the plastic backings off the sticky part and placed the band aid on top of my wound, over the ointment. It gently pressed my fingers on the band aid's edges to make sure it would stay in place. After that, my knee felt much better.",

                "text": "I was talking to my friend when I accidentally cut my hand. I needed to get something to stop the bleeding and to protect the wound from bacteria. I went to my bathroom and into the medicine cabinet, and I grabbed the box of band aids. I selected one that looked like it was the right size put the band aid box back in the cabinet. I peeled back the strips of paper that enclose the band aid and placed them on the counter. I split open the band aid, revealing the white pad that absorbs blood. I placed it over the wound and then pulled back the two plastic strips that revealed the adhesive. I pulled them snug and fixed the band aid into place. I smoothed the surface out and made sure it was a good fit. I then picked up the trash from the band aids and threw it away.",

Some of the band aids were too big, and wouldn't fit on my thumb without hanging over the tip, some were too small and wouldn't cover the cut on my thumb. I dug through the band aid bag and found a band aid that would fit. Next, I washed my hands thoroughly to make sure the cut was clean and then I dried my hands with a clean towel., Then I put some antiseptic ointment from the first aid kit on the cut, to help the cut heal faster and reduce the chance of getting an infection.

The cut was not large so a band-aid would be a suitable fix. I stopped my work and went inside to get one. I went to the bathroom to clean the wound before I applied the band-aid. I scrubbed it with soap and water, and then afterwards I applied some antiseptic. Once clean and sterile, I took a band-aid from the box and took off the adhesive backing. Very carefully, I wrapped my finger with the fresh band-aid making sure it was not too tight. When it was on, I flexed my hand to make sure it would not fall off or get in the way. When I was satisfied, I cleaned up the mess in the bathroom and put a work glove over my hand to protect the band-aid from the work to come.",

I walked inside to the bathroom and gathered some supplies from the medicine cabinet. I grabbed some alcohol, band aids, and a wash cloth. I put soap on the wash cloth and dampened it with warm water. I then gently cleaned my leg up. I then patted it try and took a cotton ball and soaked it with some alcohol. I then swabbed the cut with a circular motion with the cotton ball in order to disinfect it. I grabbed the band aid and opened up the wrapper. I removed the backings to the band aid and placed the middle portion over the cut. I rubbed the two sticky sides on my leg so they would stick. I then put all of the materials away and went on about my day.",

I wasn't paying attention, and I accidentally cut my finger with the sharp knife!  I put the knife down, and went to the bathroom, opened the medicine cabinet, and took out a box of band aids.  I also ran my cut finger under water, to clean it before I put the band aid on.  I took a band aid out of the box, and unwrapped it, so I could put it on my finger.  Then, I dried my finger off, and wrapped the band aid around the cut.  It fit snugly, and so I put the box of band aids back into the cabinet, closed the cabinet door, and went back to cooking dinner.",

With her on her red scooter and me on my blue scooter, we raced down the sidewalk at top speeds. Before I knew it, she began to wobble uncontrollably in front of me. She tried to jump off into the grass before crashing, but she landed hard on the pavement. I rushed to help her and noticed her knee was bleeding quite a bit. We walked slowly home to tend to her wounds. I took her into the bathroom and washed off her wound with soap and water. I then dried her wound with a clean towel. I reached into the cabinet and found the nearest bandages I could find. I peeled open the band-aid and took off the plastic strips. I put the padded part of the band-aid over her wound and pressed the adhesive down around it. She was ready to race again!",

The blood was gushing out, I tried to stop with  water. Then I went to my medicine cabinet, and grabbed a box of band aid. The cut was big, so I was looking for long and wide one, which cover my cut. I found one which has some antiseptic cream on.  I cleaned my wound, and pressed cotton on wound for a while till the blood stopped. Finally when it stopped then I peeled the paper from the band aid, and it exposed the sticky part of band aid. I immediately put the sticky part on my skin adjusting it according to my wound, so cushiony antiseptic part directly falls on my wound and covers it nicely. Then I pressed both side so it sticks to my finger well and wrapped around my finger securely.",

What happened,\" Laura asked as she stooped down to look at the minor scrape on Carrie's knee. \"Matty pushed me down on the swing,\" she said through stained lips. \"He pushed me real hard.\" Carries put her head down in Laura's lap there in the kitchen floor. She swooped Carrie up with a little extra spin just for fun. \"Let's go put a cool band aid on it, and you can go show him that all he did was get you a sticker,\" Laura said to her trying to cheer her up. Carries snuggled tighter to her mom as Laura flipped the bathroom light on. In the medicine cabinet, she always kept Hello Kitty and Power Ranger band aids, just in case of this happening. After cleaning the cut with antiseptic, and kissing her now happy little girl, Laura had put a hot pink band aid with Hello Kitty smiling brightly from Carrie's knee. It wasn't two minutes later that she was right out the door to show the boys how tough she was.",

Vending machines are special machines that automatically sell things like food, drinks, and other little things. Today, I'm going to buy a bottle of water from this machine. The first thing I do is put in my money. I put in one dollar, the price of the bottle I want. Then, I put in the number for the water. Every item in the machine has its own number, which you punch into a special pad to order it. Once I press the number, the machine pushes the bottle of water down, where it falls into a slot where I can pick it up from. Some machines instead grab the bottle and carry it down gently, especially of it carries bottles made from glass. Now that I've got my water, I don't feel so thirsty anymore!",

I spotted a vending machine tucked in the corner of a stairwell that sold small snacks and drinks.  I approached the vending machine and looked through the glass to decide what I wanted.  I found a bag of chips that I know I like and decided that is what I would buy.  I read the price of the chips was one dollar.  I reached into my wallet and retrieved the dollar needed to purchase the chips.  I looked back into the vending machine and found that the chips were located in the B4 position.  I put my dollar into the machine and pressed the \"B\" button and then the \"4\" button.  The coiled metal rotated and the bag of chips fell to the bottom of the machine.  I reached through the door at the bottom and retrieved my chips.",

The tag in front of the candy bar said $1.50.  I pulled two one dollar bills from wallet and placed them into the money slot and watched the machine grab and pull them inside.  I saw that I now had $2.00 of credit.  I pressed A7 on the keypad which was in front of the Reese's peanut butter cups.  I watched the circular metal wire rotate and push the candy bar forward.  I watched it drop down to bottom of the machine.  I pushed the wide door open and grabbed my candy bar. I heard two quarters fall into the coin return slot.

But, half way through, my stomach started rumbling. I tried to keep my mind off of it, but my hunger was distracting me from my work. So, I decided to grab something from the vending machine. I stopped studying, and I want to the lounge area of the library. I was surprised by all the great options available. I could choose both hot and cold items. For example, there were tiny sandwiches which could be heated up in a nearby microwave. There were also ice cream sandwiches. I love those frozen treats. I decided, however, just to get some pretzels. I put some change into the vending machine. There were codes for each item available. I entered the code for pretzels into the computer on the side of the machine. And, my pretzels dropped into the bay at the bottom of the machine. I reached into the bay, and I pulled them out. I ate them quickly. They were delicious. I then returned to my homework.",

What makes them space age is that they have a much larger selection of items than our old machines. They're refrigerated so they have sandwiches and pickles and items such as that. Another thing that makes them space age is that they take credit cards as well as cash. Today I don't have cash, so I get to go down to the vending machine with my card. I swipe the card and it tells me my card is accepted. Then I choose my item. Peanut M&M's. It's always peanut M&M's. I put in the letter and number of the item. The machine thinks about it for a second then drops my item. I bend over and push open the door at the bottom. I retrieve my candy and skip away.",

This happened to me during my family's most recent stay at a hotel. It was close to midnight, and I hadn't eaten a proper meal in hours for whatever reason. However, I knew that just down the hall from our hotel room, there were vending machines for both drinks and snacks. Knowing this, I got some loose dollars from my wallet, grabbed a room key, and went to the vending machines down the hall. I looked at the options that they had, and eventually settled for a bag of beef jerky out of the snack machine, as well as a water bottle from the drink machine. After getting my late night snack, I went back to the hotel room and enjoyed my beef jerky. I kept the water at my bedside overnight just in case I woke up thirsty.",

I did not want a whole meal, so a vending machine snack seemed like a good choice. After looking through my options I decided that some animal crackers would do the trick and help me feel full and alert before my next class. I put my seventy five cents into the coin slot and punch in A-4, which was the number under the animal crackers that I wanted. As soon as I did the stop on the animal crackers dropped just long enough for one pack of animal crackers to fall down. I reached down and pushed back the lid on the retrieval drawer. Off I went, happy to have found a vending machine and buy the animal crackers that I desired.",

It's usually a hard decision when I get there, there is so many choices of healthy snacks. I searched the rows of energy bars and veggie snacks to find what would give me the biggest boost after my exercise. I made my choice and reached for the change in my bag so I could pay for my taste treat. I put my coins into the slot in the machine until I had enough to buy my snack. I punched in the number of my selection so the machine could do its work. The coil started to spin until my energy bar fell from its slot. I pushed through the flap to retrieve my bar and started to eat.",

I pull the seven quarters out of my pocket, put it into the money slot of the vending machine and push the numbers one, three, six and the letter A.  This is the code for my favorite go to snack, chocolate covered donuts with sprinkles of coconut and almonds. This morning I am extra hungry and have found five more quarters which is enough for a container of chocolate milk.  I reach into the machine and grab my purchased donuts.  I add the five quarters and press the numbers two, four, three and the letter M.  I grab the container of milk and head over to a bench and dig into my snack.",

This was enough for a snickers bar, two bags of Doritos, and a pack of jolly ranchers. This was all in quarters, nickles, and dimes. When I got to the machine, after I bought my food, a woman came up to the machine and tried to buy a Kit-Kat.  I didn't know her well, but the machine failed.  The Kit-Kat was left hanging on the edge, almost off.  I didn't have any more money, or I would have helped her by purchasing a Kit-Kat myself.  instead, we pounded on the glass and pushed at the machine. I didn't want to risk rocking it because it was very heavy and would be lethal if it fell.  So, we just stood there frustrated, until someone else I didn't know came up and asked about our predicament. I didn't know this fellow, either. He just hit it once it exactly the right spot, and the candy bar fell down. So she got what she ordered, and we were all happy.",

When I reached there, I was already hungry and the people with me too. I usually do not like to get some from outside, but no choice. So I decided to look for vendors or machine. I saw machines, and they were so many. It made me happy. I had $10 with me. The chips were .50 each and cookies were also.50. They had some drinks which was for .50, but big can and bottles. They were very reasonable. So I entered $10 in slot and pressed  buttons for potato chips, Cheetos, Doritos, and Sun chips, total of $5, and then I got  5 bottles of Gatorade, 2 bottles of water, Fanta, Pepsi. Believe me it was enough for us.",

I glance over at the vending machine, its bright lights beckon me to the sugar and fat laden calorie rich foods in their shiny cellophane packaging. \"eat me\" the say in a silently mocking tone. I rub my pant leg to see if i have any change or dollar bills in my pocket. I feel something crunchy in my left pocket....it's a receipt. I rub my other leg and feel some coins in my pocket. \"Yes!\" just enough to buy that nutty candy bar and salty bag of chips that I really don't need. I plunge my hand into the pocket of my blue jeans and dig out several quarters and a few nickels and dimes. Shoving the change into the machine I press b5 for my first selection, and then I shove several more coins into the coin slot and press d2 for my second selection. each time the coil in the machine spins, effectively pushing the pre-packaged food item off of its cliff int of he bottom of the vending machine where I can reach in a grab my snacks.",

Bobby and Tim usually jump on their bikes and ride down to the little convenience store.  When they get there, they park their bikes, and walk in straight to the vending  machine.  They put in their 10 cent dime into the machine, and press the button next to the candy or gum they want.  The candy pops out  of the bottom of the vending machine, and they usually get two pieces of candy each. They put the candy into their sack they brought with them, and walk around the store to see if they need anything else. Sometimes they also buy a drink for the way back home, especially if it is hot outside. As they leave the store, they wave to the lady at the counter, and thank her for her help.",

I reached into my pocket and felt around - fortunately I had some spare change. I stood up from my desk with a smile on my face and started to make my way down the hall. It was the perfect time for an afternoon snack. What would I want? There were so many options. I could opt for something healthy, maybe a granola or a kind bar. Or maybe, perhaps, it was the perfect time to indulge in some chocolate. On the other hand, I could always play it safe and get some popcorn or even some potato chips. I arrived at the vending machine and glanced at my options. Fully stocked! What luck! My eyes scanned each row and column carefully, paying full attention to the grumbles of my stomach. Finally, I came to E6 - the double twix bar. I felt my hunger pang immediately. Ladies and gentleman, we have a winner. I dug into my pocked and pulled out four quarters, and hastily jammed them into the machine. The twix fell down and not wasting any time I grabbed for it, ready to take a bite and get on with my day.",

The last place I bought from a vending machine was at my school, it sells little snacks and drinks so that I don't get hungry. I walked up to the vending machine and put my money in, I had 2 dollars. After I put in the money I looked at all the choices in the machine, there was candy, nuts, crackers, and gum. I decided I wanted some candy and so I looked at what number it was and typed the number into the vending machine's key pad. The vending machine took the candy and dispensed it for me and it fell to the bottom where I was able to pick it up. I then got my change back.",

I packed some food for us to eat in the room for dinner, so we would not have to eat all of our meals out. After we finished eating our dinner, my son wanted a snack. But he did not want any that I brought with us. We decided to go explore for a vending machine. We headed down the hallway and followed the sign to the ice and vending. He could not believe all the choices that were right there in the machine. he could choose from different types of candy, several chip flavors and even pop tarts. He decided on a pack of M&Ms chocolate candy. I showed him how to put the dollar into the slot and he loved seeing it get zipped inside. He pushed the letter and number combo for his snack and watched the spring turn around until his candy dropped. He pushed the door and got his snack. he was very entertained with the process.",

I found 2 machines side by side that one sold drinks and the other sold food. I looked at the food selections and they had mostly chips and candy. I decided on buying chips. I decided on sour cream and onion chips. They cost $1.00 so I looked in my wallet to make sure I had enough money to buy it. I found 4 quarters and put them in. I pressed the number for the sour cream and onion chips and thankfully they came right out. I then moved on to the drink machine. I really wanted a Dr. Pepper. Thankfully this machine had it. The drinks costs $1.50. I took out a dollar from my wallet and 50 cents. Put the money in the machine and pressed the button for Dr. Pepper. Out came the Dr. Pepper, which was super cold and oh so good. I loved my snacks from the vending machine.",

I walked down the hall to the vending machine near the office.  I knew there had to be something there that would hold me off till I got home.  I smiled when I saw my favorite snack.  I reached down into my pocket and pulled out a dollar bill.  The machine wouldn't take my dollar though!  A girl passing by traded my dollar for a crisper one.  I tried again.  This time I was successful and the sugary goodness would be all mine!  I pressed the number on the keypad that corresponded with the snack I wanted.  It slowly edged toward me and dropped down.  I reached down to pick up my food.  I thought I deserved it now.",

The vending machine had many options to choose from. I decided I did not want anything sweet. I would rather eat something salty. The vending machine had a few different flavors of potato chips, such as original, sour cream and onion, cheddar and sour cream, and barbecue. The vending machine also contained other types of salty snacks such as Sun Chips, Doritos, Cheez Its, Goldfish, and Ritz Bits. I ended up choosing the sour cream and onion potato chips. They cost $1. I inserted a dollar bill, pressed the button that corresponded to the chips I wanted, and watched the machine retrieve the bag of chips for me. I reached into the slot to take the chips. I then enjoyed my snack.",

This alley also has a eatery inside, so the waitress came over to see if we wanted to order anything. We ordered deep fried calamari, onion rings, and cold stouts all around. Waitress came back with out food and drinks pretty quick, in about 15 minutes., I thought it would be longer given how packed it was. This game is not going in my favor.

Everyone put on their shoes and walked over to the ball storage rack to select our bowling balls. I picked a purple ball and my friend picked a pink one. Someone else picked a green one! After everyone had their balls we sat down to figure out the order in which we would bowl. We all wrote our names down on the scorecard and I was assigned to be the person to keep score. We had a great night taking turns bowling, and my friend had the highest score at the end! When we were done, we all turned in our shoes at the counter, said goodbye, and went home to eat dinner.",

We each then went up to the rental counter to rent some bowling shoes. We each gave the attendant out sizes, and she was able to find the right shoes for each of us on one of the many shelves of shoes. We went back to our lane and sat down to put our shoes on. We then each selected a bowling ball that was the right weight for us. I programmed the computer for our lane so that each of our names showed on the screen above us. We each rolled our balls down the lane, taking two turns at a time. None of us did very well, but we still had fun knocking down pins and catching up. At the end of the games, we returned our shoes and left the bowling alley.",

Will brought his own ball and when he stepping in the door he could smell that fresh bowling smell. so Will went up to the counter and asked the woman operating the shoe station for a size ten pair of shoes. He laced up his shoes and was ready to go. he saw an open court and he took it. he pressed the new game button and off he went. he saw that the pins were set up in a very specific way but he was ready for that challenge. he rolled the ball so far onto the lane that it knocked out all of the bowling pins and he received a strike! everyone was so amazed. Will did amazing. he kept bowling until the night ended.  he got so tired that he eventually had to call it a night and go home. Will returned the bowling shoes and laced up his old regular ones again taking those shops off was like taking power away from him. Will got back in his car and drove back home.",

At Friday 8 PM, we all meet up at the bowling alley and we check in with the worker. He charges us an admission and shoe rental fee. After changing into our new shoes, we head to our lane. The first round took us about 40 minutes to complete. After getting the hang of everything, we complete the second round in only 20 minutes. Everything took us about an hour to complete. At about 9 PM, we decide to leave so we return our shoes and proceed to leave. After saying our goodbye's we go our separate ways. On the way home, I decide that I had a good time bowling so I remind myself to schedule another event very soon.",

We had a team battle where all the girls took on the boys at one point my team being the boys were down and we needed a major comeback and eventually what happened was I was able to bring the boys back into the game. Finally the game came down to one last move, If I got a strike we would win and if I didn't we would lose and surprisingly I was able to get the strike and get my team the win! I had so much fun and I would like to go back one day.",

We took turns throwing the ball down the hall and trying to hit the pins on the other side.  She was a lot better than me and scored more points.

I guess I will have to come bowl more often. I also like the styles of the bowling alley. The shoes they give you are so nice. I like the old feel and look of them. It is weird thought that so many other people have put their feet into these shoes before. It is alright the shoes are fine. There are also a lot of other shoes to choose from in the store there. You can pick white ones or red ones, and you can even buy new balls there too. Just ask for the service department. Anyway, after I bowled my big round my family took me out to dinner to celebrate. I have nothing but good memories of bowling.",

We laced up the shoes and set up our scorecard with each of our names displayed on the screen. Then one of my friends went to get us all sodas and snacks, and when she got back we started the game. The first game we played just to warm up, so we didn't keep score on the screen. We just took a few turns to get into the groove. Then we got serious and began tracking the score. I won the first game, but then my luck ran out. My friend Sarah won the next two games. Jill did not win any games, but she was a wonderful friend and kept our snacks and drinks filled. Mary Beth was the scorekeeper, though she didn't win either! When the game was over, we traded back for our shoes and drove home.",

I put the shoes on to make sure they fit, and was told which lane would be mine to bowl in. I went to my lane with my bowling ball, which was just the right size and not too heavy. I stepped up to the line on the floor and swung the ball under my right shoulder onto the floor. The ball hit the floor and rolled quickly down the center of the lane. A lot of pins were lined up at the end of the lane, and my ball rolled right through the center of them. All the pins fell down and I scored a strike. I was very impressed, and a machine picked the pins back up for me and put them back at the end of the lane. I threw my ball a few more times until the game was over.",

When we got to the bowling alley it was pretty crowded and we had to wait in line to get a lane.  We bought two games and rented some shoes.  Mary and I entered our names in the computer at the bowling lane so that we could keep score. We both got to pick out balls from a rack.  After we did that, we started bowling.  Mary was able to knock down all the pins a few times so she got strikes.  I usually knocked down just a few at a time.  When the game reached a score of three hundred, Mary won. In between the first game and the second game we bought some food from the counter.  We played one more game and then decided to go home. Mary and I returned our shoes and drove home.",

The people at the front desk were very nice.  They asked us how many games we wanted to bowl. I wasn't sure, and I looked at my wife.  We decided we would bowl two games.  They asked us what size shoe that we wore.  I told her that I wore a size 11.  The lady got me a size 11 shoe and told us to go to lane 2.  My wife also wanted a drink, so we went to the concession stand.  We bought a soda and went to lane 2.  We both put on our shoes, and then we searched through the balls to find ones we liked.  Once we found our shoes, we began bowling.  I went first, and my wife went after.  We exchanged turns throwing the ball, and we kept each others score.",

After everyone had their shoes and their balls, we went to our assigned lane.  Once there, we had to set up the computer that keeps track of the scores by putting in our names.  When that was done, my friend Darren went first. He got a strike!  After Darren, Lori, Ann, and Jeff went.  I went last and got a gutter ball.  I got to go again and I knocked over five pins.  The computer calculated our scores and we went onto the next frame.  At the end, the computer tallied everyone's final scores.",

However, when the local bowling alley opened up, that instantly became a popular spot to hang out. It had just about everything from arcade games to bowling to a bar, and they served great food. A usual visit to the bowling alley involved me and either a group of friends or family. We would start things off with an actual game of bowling. We would go over to the counter to check in and get our bowling shoes, followed by getting our lane. While one person set up the game of bowling, the rest of us would go and get the right sized bowling ball that we wanted. When everything was all set, we'd proceed with our game. I usually always came in last, since I'm not very good at bowling. After the game of bowling, we'd go off ad play arcade games and laser tag.",

I've never experienced what it's like to do so and I wanted to change that, so I agreed to go bowling with them. They went online to book a reservation for our group of five people. We traveled to the place by car and we arrived 10 minutes early. I was so surprised once I saw the setup we had. Everything was glow in the dark. They call it cosmic bowling. We all put on our bowling shoes and then we had to agree on which bowling ball we would use. I was shown how to put my fingers in the holes of the bowling ball. Then I stood behind the foul line which is a piece of colored tape or painted line, aimed for the pin at the front of 10 pins, and rolled the ball down the lane. I knocked 7 pins down on my first try. I had such a great time and told my friends to never come without me,",

I was excited and met them at the bowling alley about ten minutes from my home.  When I got there I rented bowling shoes in my size and put them on over my socks than met with my friends.  I bowled a few times not hitting any of the pins down.  Than to my amazement I aimed for the center and made a strike!  All the pins fell down.  I was very excited.  How could I recreate this again I wondered?  Throughout the evening I kept aiming for the center and made a few more strikes.  Bowling takes a lot of practice but above all it is fun.  It was nice playing with my friends and we made a great evening out of it.  Next time I think I will bring other people with me!",

                "text": "Yesterday I went bowling with my friends.  They told me that they would meet me at the bowling alley at 3pm.  At 2pm I started getting ready.  By 2:30pm I was ready.  I made sure to bring socks with me, since you will need socks once you get to the bowling alley.  I grabbed my car keys and got in my car.  I drove to the bowling alley.  I listened to a little bit of music on my way.  Once I got to the bowling alley, I parked my car and then walked inside.  Once I was inside, I walked over to my friends.  I asked them how many games they wanted to bowl. They told me that they wanted to play two games.  I walked over to the cashier, I asked how much each game would cost.  The cashier said that each game would cost $3.50.  I wanted two play two games with my friends so I paid $7.00.  Next, I needed to buy shoes so that I could bowl.  I needed special shoes to go bowling so that I wouldn't slip on the floor when I went to bowl.  I asked the cashier for a pair of shoes, size eight and paid four dollars for a pair.  Now I needed a bowling ball.  But I didn't want a bowling ball that would be too heavy.  So I chose one that was only five pounds.  All of my friends came over to our lane where we were bowling.  We all put in our names so that each of us were playing on the same game.  I was first.  Before I started I made sure to put on my bowling shoes, and leave my old shoes by where we were sitting.  Then I took my bowling ball, put my fingers in each hole, aimed, swung my arm back then I let go of the bowl.  The bowling ball flew down the lane.  Out of the ten pins I knocked down six.  Since I didn't knock down all of the pens, I got to go one more time, before it was my friend Sarah's turn to bowl.  I bowled again! This time I knocked down four pins.  Since I knocked down all of the pins I got a spare! By the end of the game I had won the most points out of all of my friends! I won! I returned my bowling shoes and then we all left to go eat dinner!",

I make sure to help them if they have trouble with the words, so that we can all learn from our mistakes. We usually read a chapter in our bedtime book, but then it is time to close their eyes and drift off to sleep. I make  sure to kiss their heads before I cut off the light and pull the covers up so they stay warm.

First we went into the bathroom. I started running the bath while my daughter undressed. I put bubble bath in the water and helped my daughter step into the bathtub. After about 10 minutes, it was time for her to get out of the tub. I gave her a towel to dry off with and helped her get into her pajamas. After she brushed her teeth, we went to the bedroom. I tucked my daughter into the bed so that she was nice and warm and comfortable under the blankets. I sang a lullaby to her and then turned off the lights, leaving only a nightlight on. I said \"sweet dreams,\" and quietly stepped out of the room so she could fall asleep peacefully.",

Next, he gets into pajamas and brushes his teeth. After that, he comes and holds my hand and tells me he is ready for his books. We both walk hand in hand to my bed, where he sleeps. He picks some books and climbs up into bed. We pull down the covers and both get cozy. I read him two, three or four books until he feels settled and tired enough. Then, I turn out the light and lay next to him as he says his prayers. He then tells me his favorite part of the day.

She listened to the story as I read from the book, helping me turn the page. It was not past her bed time so I told her she needed to go to sleep. I tucked her into her bed and made sure she was not going to fall out and on to the floor, maybe hurting her self. Once she was tucked in, I brought her a glass of water just in case she got thirsty in the middle of the night. I shut the door and let her sleep.",

We didn't bother to wake them up to brush their teeth ( I feel guilty whenever this happens. ) we covered them up made sure night lights were on and kissed them goodnight. Our son was still up so we took the opportunity to snuggle a bit longer before taking him to brush his teeth. After teeth were brushed we made sure the night light was on and that he was all set for the night. Hugged him real tight gave him a kiss and said goodnight. Five minutes pass. \"I need a drink.\" Five more minutes pass. \"I need to go pee\" Five more minutes pass. \"will you rub my neck and hair until I fall asleep?",

After I had her in my arms, I walked slowly to her room that was dark.  I walked up to her crib and made sure that there was nothing in there that she could grab.  With one gentle swoop, I place her down in her crib.  She stretched a little bit, but kept her eyes clothes.  I slowly backed away from her room and made sure not to trip on anything.  As I backed up, I shut the door behind me so that no light would get into my daughter's room as she slept.",

I asked if she was ready to lie down and go to bed. She had no issue at all saying yes, and I was a little tired myself, for it was a long week. I extended my hand for her to grab and help up out of the couch and walked her to bed. We made small talk, letting each other know we had a great day together, and looking forward to the next. My daughter jumped right in bed immediately after brushing her teeth and using the restroom one final time for the evening. I opened up the covers for her, fluffed up her pillows, and she lied down. I gave her a kiss, tucked her in, we both said goodnight with a loving smile, and I exited the room, leaving her to her sweet dreams.",

This was really tough because she was hyper and did not want to go to sleep. I had to follow a whole structured routine to get her to go to sleep so that she would sleep. This was somewhat difficult, but I first walked upstairs with her and picked out a book, then went to her room and read the book together. When I noticed her start to get tired, I slowly started to stop reading and I left the room. I used the monitor to watch her and noticed that shortly after, she fell asleep. This was not overly difficult, but I had to follow the whole routine to get her to go to sleep. Eventually she fell asleep for the night.",

Alex played with his bath toys, and splashed around in the bubbles. He then got dried off and put on his pajamas. Last night he wore his favorite pajamas with Lightning McQueen from the movie \"Cars\". We went into the bathroom and brushed our teeth, Alex used his green Crayola crayon toothbrush, and got his teeth nice and clean. We then read a bedtime story, last night was Goodnight Fish, which was a book he got when he and his grandparents went to visit the aquarium. After that, he got tucked into his crib, with his favorite blanket, and his favorite stuffed animals: a lamb and a penguin. We sang \"Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star\", and turned off the lights. Like each night, it was a good night.",

She was only two so she needed a lot of help. After she was all ready to go to bed, we sat in a chair together to read a couple of bedtime stories. When we were halfway through the the second story, I looked over and noticed that her eyes were starting to close. I shut the book and put it on the bookshelf, and slowly picked my sister up. I brought her over to her bed and laid her down on top of her pillow. I tucked the blankets up over her head, made sure she had her pacifier, and shut all of the lights except her nightlight off as I left and shut the door.",

Then, I take his hand and lead him to bed, he usually is yawning by the time we get there. I make sure he's in his pajamas and then under the covers. I usually read him a story that I let him pick out. The other night he picked out \"Where the Wild Things Are\" which is also his favorite book. After the story, I'll kiss him goodnight and turn off the light, but usually Jimmy will ask me to turn his nightlight on, but not always as sometimes Jimmy likes to look out his window, but only when the moon is bright and the sky is not cloudy. I will tell him \"good night,\" one last time before I close his door and go to bed myself.",

Once he is done, he changes into clothes for sleeping so that his other clothes stay clean while he sleeps. He crawls into bed and I pull the covers over him. His head rests on his pillow so he is comfortable and can fall asleep better. He is afraid of the dark like me, so I leave a nightlight on for him in the hallway. A little light at night can help you feel better and more relaxed, but too much light keeps you awake. I tuck him in and say goodnight and let him fall asleep.",

Mom asked me to try to wake her when the movie was over, but she just snored louder every time I tried to shake her awake. She was such a deep sleeper. Dad sometimes joked that she could sleep through a brass band marching through her room. I believed it now. I had tried very hard to wake her up. I went in and told my mom I couldn't get her up. Mom smiled and hugged me, told me good night, and patted my head. I went into the living room to watch as she kissed Emily on the forehead. She gently slid her arms under Emily's sleeping body, and lifted her up to chest level. I followed her up the stairs and to the room me and Emily shared. Mom pulled the covers down on Emily's bed, and I pulled mine down. Emily woke up just enough to climb down from Mom and snuggle under the covers. Mom kissed us both once more and turned out the light.",

He dawdled a bit but finally started getting ready for bed.  First of all he had to take a bath.  He splashed in the tub and spilt water all over the floor.  Next he dried off in a big, fluffy blue towel.  Then he brushed his teeth with his special Star Wars toothbrush.  Next he dressed in his Star Wars underwear and then put on his Star Wars pajamas.  His dad and I tucked him into his bed that was made with Star Wars sheets.  He said his prayers.  Next was story time.  I pulled out his favorite book about (you guessed it) Star Wars.  He gradually dozed off dreaming about Anakin Skywalker and a galaxy far, far away.",

Then , I had some lunch , took my backpack and left the house . I had to walk to the bus stop . On the way , I could smell the exhaust from the cars and I already started freaking out . The exhaust is really unhealthy for you . Then I waited for the bus at the stop . After 20 minutes , the bus I needed finally came . The bus came to stop , the doors opened . I stepped onto the bus and gave the driver my money .",

I started the car up , but I noticed that I left my phone at work , so I turned the ignition back off , locked the car doors , and shut the driver door . Unfortunately for me , I shut the door WITH my keys still in the ignition . That 's right ; I was locked out of my own car . Flustered and embarrassed , I pulled at the handles of the doors and attempted to open the trunk off the car - no luck at all . I walked back to my office , got my phone , and contemplated what I would do next . There was no one there with me , so my only hope was riding the public bus -LRB- I did n't have money for a cab -RRB- . I waited for the bus , the last one of the night , at the bus stop . The bus driver opened the door for me and I came aboard . I paid the two dollar bus fare so that I could ride and asked him for a transfer so that I could get on the next bus at the terminal . I took my seat , and the bus took me to the terminal at the plaza . I got off the bus and hopped on the bus that would take me home . I handed the transfer to the driver and took my seat . As I approached my apartment , I pushed the button to request for the bus to stop . The driver pulled over , and I thanked them and got off . When I got in the apartment , I immediately jumped into my bed . I was dead-tired , and though I had the dilemma of having my keys locked in the car , I would figure that out in the morning .",

The bus driver scanned my bus card and I walked to an empty bench near the middle of the bus . Many other passengers boarded the bus after me and soon the bus was nearly full . Looking around me , I saw a number of senior citizens as well as other young adults . There was even a woman with a sleeping baby sitting on the bus near my bench . I decided to listen to music on my smart phone while I waited for the bus to reach my destination . The bus stopped every few minutes to let other passengers on and off of the bus .

There was a lot of different people on the bus , some were kids going to school others were adults going to work like I was . I watched the bus come to a stop every few blocks and drop off a few people , but for every person that left a new person got on . I noticed my stop was near so I pushed the strip on the wall that notifies the bus driver my stop is coming up . When he pulled into the next stop I exited the back of the bus and was happy that after 15 minutes I finally reached my destination .",

Once I got there , I waited for the bus to arrive along with two other people . After about 15 minutes , an express bus heading to Manhattan arrived . I boarded the bus and paid the driver my fare . I then walked to a window seat near the front of the bus , that was free . It was pretty early , and the bus was initially somewhat empty . However , several stops later , the bus was filled with fellow commuters heading to work . Along the way , the bus passed through about 5 different towns while traveling on local roads , before headed out to the George Washington Bridge to get to Manhattan . While getting there , the bus ran into a traffic jam which caused a 20 minute delay . After working its way through traffic , the bus made it onto the bridge , and several minutes later , we were at the bus terminal on 178th Street . Once we got there , the bus stopped and the driver let us out , whereby I then walked to the office .",

In our city , it is very packed , so driving is n't as convenient or affordable . Parking is expensive so public transportation saves us a lot of money . Every morning when I go to school , I wait by the bus stop . The morning bus comes every ten minutes . Once it arrives I board onto the bus and I insert my metro card . The metro card has a balance of money stored inside it . This money is subtracted from the balance every time I ride the bus and insert my metro card . Basically the metro card pays for the bus ride . When I run out of money , I go to a metro card machine and put more money into my balance . Riding the bus is annoying sometimes . In the morning , it is very crowded so sometimes there are n't enough seats for everybody . This means I have to stand while holding on to a pole . Sometimes its so crowded that I am sandwiched in between people . If I am lucky , sometimes there will be open seats . Otherwise , I have to stand for 40 minutes .",

                "text": "Yesterday my car broke down , so I was thinking of how I would get to work . I decided one of the best options would be to take a public bus . Since I 've never taken one before , I went to the city website and looked at a schedule of all the bus times and routes . When I had finally decided on the bus that I needed to take , it was time to put my plan into action . I left my house and walked over to the bus stop . There were a few other people waiting there as well . When the bus arrived I got on and paid the driver the fee , which was $ 1 . I then sat down and waited for the bus to arrive at my destination . It took about 40 minutes to get where I was going , and I arrived safely . I think that overall it was a pleasant experience .",

I also brought a book along to read so nobody would try to talk to me . The bus made three stops before we got to the corner nearest to my work . Each time people would get off and as they shuffled past would bump into my knees which was really annoying . Then more people would get on and some would find seats , but others had to stand . One person stood directly in front of me , in constant contact with my legs . This really annoyed me even more . I don ' t like riding public transportation .

The first thing I had to do was find a bus schedule and learn how to read the time and places to catch the bus and how to make any needed transfers . This was a little hard to do but once I figured it out it was OK as long as I always kept a schedule with me . I mostly took the bus to work and I only had to worry about catching one bus on the street I lived on and I did not have to sorry about any transfers . The bus ride cost me $ 1.25 and transfers where an additional 50 cents . Many people rode the bus and I meet several nice people on the bus . The bus drivers were always nice and I became friends with several of them . The bus only came once an hour and I had to make sure I did not miss it if I was going to work because then I would be late for work . The bus always made a stop at the main depot in order to pick up more people . There was usually about a 20 minute wait so the driver could have break in the late afternoon . I did not like having to take the bus but it served my purpose for a while and I was thankful to have the bus available .",

Each person in front of us climbed the steps and put a token into the machine at the front of the bus . We had no token , so we gave the bus driver our money and he gave us tokens to put in . We found a seat at the back of the bus and sat down . We checked our bus schedule and decided where we wanted to get off . When the sign at the front of the bus showed that it was our stop , we gathered our things and prepared to get off . After we got off , we made a note of which bus stop we were at and the time the bus would be there again to take us home . Then we went off to explore the town .",

                "text": "Yesterday I had to go across town to the library to return some books . All my friends were busy and my car was in for repairs , so I had to take the bus . First thing was to see what bus I needed . I went over to my computer and pulled up the bus schedules for my city . I found the nearest bus stop and checked the bus lines that stopped there , then looked for the stop nearest the library . There was a bus that went to both stops , so I would n't have to change buses to get there . Next I found the next time the bus would be at the stop near my house , which was only 15 minutes from now . I grabbed the books and headed out to walk to the bus stop . I got to the stop about 5 minutes early and waited for the bus to arrive . It was only 2 minutes late , which is n't too bad . I climbed into the bus , paid the driver and found an empty seat . It was a pretty nice day , so I just sat there looking out the window until we got to the stop by the library . I got off the bus and went inside to return my books . It was a good bus ride , no problems with traffic at all .",

Daddy took the car to work each day now and her and mommy decided they wanted to go to the shopping center . Hannah was excited because today was her first time taking the public bus . Hannah and her family had moved to Portland , Maine and the bus they were taking was called the Metro . Hannah took her mom 's hand as they walked down the sunny streets of the city until they reached a sign that Hannah could not read but she did understand the picture . It was a picture of a bus . '' `` Does that sign say bus mommy ? '' '' Hannah asked . Her mother replied that it was and it was one of many many places around the city to get the bus to stop for them and others . They waited for a long while and finally a large public bus came down the street and stopped before them . They waited while a few passengers exited the bus because her mom said it was the polite thing to do and then they climbed the steps where her mother dropped their coins into the busses toll collector . Her mother then asked for a transfer and they walked quickly to their seats . Hannah asked her mom what a transfer was and she explained that because they were going way across the city they would need to get on yet another bus and the transfer was so the other bus driver could see they already paid for their ride . Soon the bus jolted to another stop an older lady stepped onto the bus and flashed a card at the bus driver and took a seat at the front of the bus that was saved for elderly and handicapped people . Hannah tugged at her moms sleeve and whispered the lady did not pay . Her mother quietly told her she had a bus pass that she paid for a whole months worth of rides for a bigger fee than just one ride . That people who use the bus daily buy them to save money . Hannah thought to herself she would like bus passes for her and mommy . She enjoyed the bumpy ride with the jolting stops and wide turns that made her have to hold on tight . Hannah also noticed people pulling a cord and she figured out why . It made the bus driver stop where ever they would like to get off . Oh how she wanted to pull the string but , mommy told her no . It was only for when you needed it . Soon the bus stopped at the busy bus station . They stepped off the bus and got on a new bus . Her mom handed the bus driver their transfers . Hannah was excited because this meant the next place they were going was the shopping center to buy her new shoes . Soon the bus took off and made stop after stop . They even picked up a man in a wheelchair . He drove his wheelchair right up a special ramp and into a spot on the bus where the driver buckled him and his wheelchair in . Soon Hannah 's mom told her she could pull the cord to make the bus stop . The cord was up high but with a little help from her mom she reached it . Ding ! The bus came to a stop shortly after and there was the shopping center right in front of them . Taking the bus was a fun form of transportation . Hannah waved to the driver as he pulled away to pick up and drop off even more people around the city .",

When I get on the bus , I have to pay the bus fare . I live in a big city , so there 's always a lot of people needing to take the bus . Therefore ; sometimes I am not lucky to find a seat to sit on . In that case , I would have to stand up . Overall , riding a bus is not enjoyable because it tends to be dirty , people are very loud , and it is very crowded . Not to mention , it always smells like urine . My commute is always a long one . I usually stay on the bus for one hour . For that one hour on the bus , I listen to music or play on my cell phone . Eventually , I get to my stop . I get off the bus and reach my destination .",

I set out from my apartment with a spring in my step , because it was an amazing day . I walked through my apartment complex 's parking lot to reach the bus stop , where I waited for the bus around 5 minutes . When it came to a stop in front of me , I boarded and put a $ 1 bill and 2 quarters in the fare machine . I selected a seat near the entrance , because it has more space and fewer people . Riding the bus often gives me motion sickness , so I closed my eyes and tried to ignore the swaying motion as it rolled down the street . Behind me , two college students were eagerly discussing a class project . In the very back , a small child was loudly pretending to be a dinosaur . I was glad when I finally reached my destination . I pulled the cord signaling that I would need the bus to stop next to the hospital , and got up to exit out the bus 's side door . Fresh air never smelled so good !",

                "text": "I live near the city of Santa Cruz and often take the 17X bus to the nearby city of San Jose . It 's possible to get discount fares by paying for multiple rides in advance , but I usually pay cash , five dollars for one-way . I get to my small town 's transit center early on weekday mornings , because the bus fills up quickly , and most good seats are already taken by riders who started their trip in downtown Santa Cruz . We wait in line in civilized fashion . Some people need only show the driver their pass , some shove a five-dollar bill into the fare machine efficiently . But some fumble with small coins or ask other riders for change , which makes everyone in line restive . Once on , riders can choose seats grouped around small tables , seats facing forward , or seats facing sideways . Table seats are premium , since the bus has WiFi and many people bring laptops . Others prefer seats in the back where the roughnecks are , just like in high school . My little town is the last stop before highway 17 . The bus whips along amid the pine trees and the yellow-flowered acacia that blooms this time of year . It is pleasant not to have to keep your eyes on the road . Unspoken bus etiquette decrees that strangers do n't speak to each other , but of course some people know each other and chat . Many tap away on their machines or play video games , others read books or enjoy the ride . It ends at San Jose 's train station , where passengers can transfer to the San Francisco train , or take a rattling inferior 1-hour bus ride to Fremont to catch the BART mass transit line to Oakland , Richmond , or distant Pittsburg , where the California Delta begins .",

It came on time , and the bus driver let off the other passengers . I stepped onto the bus and paid the driver the fare . Then I found an open seat by a window and sat down . The ride was around 15 minutes or so . Then the driver announced my stop . I headed out the back doors . Outside , I found a bench and sat down . The next bus came fairly quickly . I hopped on and showed the driver my transfer ticket . This time , the bus was packed , so I found a pole and hung on . The ride was n't too long , however , and soon I was at my final destination . I found my way off the bus and walked over to school .",

                "text": "Last Friday , my car broke down . I had to get to work Monday , so I decided to ride the public bus since it ran fairly close to my home and work both . Monday morning I got ready early and set off to wait at the bus stop . After sitting for quite a while , the bus finally pulled up . I let others at the stop get on first , then I got on . I asked the bus driver how much the fare was and he told me . I paid the fare by sticking my money in the box near the bus driver , and walked to find a free seat . I found one near the back of the bus , and I sat down . The bus ride was fairly quick and uneventful . I noted that the ride went the same route that I did . Once the bus stopped at the stop near my work , I disembarked . That 's how I rode the public bus .",
