Unfortunately I did not have a spare tire so I had to carry my bike the rest of the way home . After the gruesome trek back to my house I flipped the bicycle upside down and began my repair . First I took off the outer tire to replace my tube with a better more expensive tube that has the ability to fix a puncture . I do not want to experience carrying my bike a mile ever again . After putting the new tube on I screw back on the tire and put the outer tire over the tube . I then fill the PSI to 170 in my tire and listen for any leaking air . Then I spin the tire to make all the slime inside become evenly distributed throughout . This will prevent leaks in the future and even with a slight leak I will still be able to ride back home and fix the tire quickly yet again .",

I pour water on my body then I lather up with either soap or shower gel . Once I have soap all over my body , I take my loofah sponge and pour soap on that as well . I , then , begin to scrub my body as firm but gently as I can . I do this to ensure that all the dirt washes off my skin . While I am scrubbing my body , I like to sing in the shower .

Then we went to the supermarket and bought all of them . After bringing all of our ingredients home , we followed the recipe instructions closely to ensure we were not doing anything wrong . We put our ingredients together to make sure they were at the right temperature , preheated the oven , and pulled out the proper utensils . We then prepared the batter using eggs and some other materials we purchased and then poured them into a pan . We then put the pan in the oven and baked it according to the instructions . After baking the cake in the oven for the time the recipe told us too , we then double checked to make sure it was done by pushing a knife into the center . We saw some crumbs sticking to the knife when we pulled it out so we knew it was ready to eat !",

I 'd already tried using my bike pump ; it would inflate a little but I could never get it anywhere close to fully inflated . I know from past experience those fix-a-flat or emergency bike repair kits are pretty worthless . I think they 're made for the narrow old tires you 'd see on ten-speed street bikes . I have a mountain bike with large tires and a lot of pressure is needed to keep them inflated . Since I only live a few blocks from a bicycle repair shop I decided to take the bike there . I bought it at that shop anyway so I figured they 'd do the service for free , as promised . I stopped by , they took it in the back , replaced the inner tube of the tire , inflated it , and it was as good as new . Best of all , they only charged me ten bucks for the tube . That 's the beauty of local , independently own businesses . They really care about their customers .",

I set the water temperature to a nice warm setting . While the tub is filling , I will gather two fluffy towels and a face cloth . I also pour myself a glass of ice water to sip on while I 'm soaking . I go and grab the latest magazine that I 've been waiting to read and put it next to the tub . Once the tub is filled , I climb in . I start by washing my face and then my hair . After my hair is washed , I put a deep conditioner in my hair . Now , it 's time to relax . I let the conditioner sit while I read my magazine and sip some water . After 15 minutes , I rinse my hair out and then wash my body with soap . I rinse off and then give myself a few more minutes of soaking before I empty the tub . After I dry off , I rinse the tub out to make sure that I leave the tub clean and shiny for the next time I use it .",

I had already picked the spot it was to go , a place in the middle of my yard where it could get full sun . After gathering the shovel and watering hose , and putting on my gardening gloves , I set to work on digging the hole . I had to make sure the hole was deep enough to fit its roots comfortably . I dampened the soil in the hole with a little water . Once the hole was ready , I laid the tree on its side and gently removed the pot from it . I placed the sapling into the hole and looked to see that the base of its trunk would be level with the ground , then began scraping the soil back into the hole , over the roots . I tamped the soil down , so as to prevent any air pockets , and watered it once more . I think this little tree will make a wonderful addition to my yard !",

There were many people flying on this plane and the waiting room was crowded . Then the plane pulled in next to the gate and the flight attendant started calling people over to board the plane . We were near last to get on the plane . Once on the plane we found our seats and sat down . After the plane took off the stewardess did a demonstration about how to use the emergency exits .

I 'd say that the ideal temperature for the water was about 90 degrees . My favorite part of taking a bath was the bubbles . I loved to splash around the tub and play with the bubbles . Once I sat in the tub , I used shampoo to wash my hair and a washed my body with a soapy washcloth . I made sure to wash behind my ears and on my face as well . Once I was clean , I would play with my bath toys for a little while . After some time has passed , I drained the water . After draining the water , I would stand up and dry myself off with a towel . I enjoyed taking baths because I often needed to be cleaned , I loved to play outside as a kid .",

                "text": "Baking a cake can be a lot of fun . Plus , at the end , you have a yummy cake to eat ! First , decide what kind of cake to make . Do you have a recipe written down ? A recipe is a set of instructions for making a particular cake . Make sure to read the recipe all the way through before you start , so there are no surprises ! Then gather all your ingredients together : flour , sugar , eggs , and whatever else your recipe says . Next , you need to pre-heat the oven . Your recipe will tell you what temperature to use . While the oven heats up , you mix your ingredients in a big bowl . Next , you need to prepare the baking pans . Look again at the recipe . It will tell you what size pan to use , and whether it needs to be greased . To grease a pan means to put a thin layer of shortening or butter on the bottom and sides , so the cake wo n't stick . You 'll use two pans if you 're making a layered cake . When the pan or pans are ready , pour in the well-mixed ingredients . Check if the oven is hot enough -- has it reached the temperature you set it to yet ? If so , slide your pan right into the middle of the oven , and close it up . The recipe will say how many minutes it will take for the cake to bake . It 's a good idea to set a timer , because you do n't want to forget about it , and have a burnt cake , after all your hard work ! While the cake cooks , it 's a good idea to clean up the kitchen . You 're almost there ! When your timer goes off , you can check if the cake is done by sticking a toothpick into the middle . If the toothpick comes out dry , and not gooey , your cake is done . Turn off the oven , and carefully remove the hot cake with oven mitts on . Unfortunately , now you have to leave it alone until it cools . When it 's cooled , turn it out of the pan , and put the frosting on , if your cake is a frosted cake . Next is the best part : slice that cake into eight , put a slice on a plate , and enjoy !",

It was warm and humid outside so besides being caked in dirt , I also had sweated a lot and did not smell very good . I wanted to get everything done in one day so I had worked very hard for a very long time . However , when I went inside to clean up , I realized from an automated message in my voice mail that the water had been shut off temporarily for emergency repairs , it would be on again in a few hours . I was frustrated , but I decided that I was hungry as well so I made myself a sandwich and cut up some fruit to eat . I took off my dirty clothes and put them in the hamper and put on a clean t-shirt and shorts and then put down an old blanket on my couch before I sat on it so I would not get it dirty . I watched part of a baseball game until I could not stand my own stench any more . I went to try the water in my bath tub and was extremely glad when it worked . I ran myself a hot bath and put some bubble bath soap in it . I got in and found it very relaxing . I was so glad to finally take a bath , get cleaned up , and relax after a long , hard , productive day .",

                "text": "I like taking a bath instead of a shower sometimes . I start by closing the drain at the bottom of the tub . Some tubs have a stopper and some have a thing you push down to close it . After it 's closed I like to run both hot and cold water to make warm water and then I let the tub fill up to about a hand 's height from the top of the tub . While the water is running , I squirt in bubbles and make sure I have a clean washcloth and towel . After I carefully climb into the tub , I make sure I wash my whole body with the soap and washcloth , even behind my ears and between my toes . Then I can either soak and relax in the tub or I can play with toys . Fun toys for the bathtub are boats and plastic water animals like whales and ducks . Once the water starts to turn a little cold , it 's time to get out so I open the drain again and let the water empty out . While it 's draining I carefully stand up and reach for my towel to dry off . I always be sure the tub is clean when I 'm finished , with toys and the dirty washcloth put where they belong .",

We decided we would make a special dessert to have after the meal . We went to the grocery store to get some of the ingredients we thought we would need . Once at the grocery store we chose the dessert we were going to serve as a treat for our guests . We picked up flour , sugar , and several other ingredients needed to bake a cake . Once we returned home we started to mix together a batter for our cake . Once the batter was just right we evenly spread it in a pan and placed it in the oven . After some time in the oven to bake our cake was ready to take out so we could add frosting . After the cake cooled we added the frosting and set it aside to wait for our guests to come and try the delicious treat .",

The cars are his under water taxi 's for the fish , he says . He sits amiss the bubbles playing with his toys and laughing . We do the toe test , which is when i look at his toes and if they are wrinkle then time is up . Yup toes are wrinkled , he laughs as wash his body and hair . I let the water out as he sits there and waits for the tub to empty , only then does he want to get out . He helps to dry himself off and put his pajamas on . Now it is time for bed .",

                "text": "I love cherries . I thought it would nice if I had a cherry tree in my backyard . There was plenty of room in my yard for a large tree , so I decided to plant one . I drove my pickup truck to a nursery near where I live . They had many different types of trees there , all growing in large pots . The trees were very skinny , but I knew once they were out of the pots and planted in the ground , they would grow into large trees . I found some cherry trees and saw how much they would cost . I asked a man who worked at the nursery if he would put the tree in my pickup after I paid for it . I went to the cashier and paid for the tree and the man loaded it into my truck . When I got home , I got a shovel and dug a huge hole where I wanted the tree to grow . I made sure all the big rocks and roots from other trees were not left in the hole . I added some manure so the roots would get all the extra nutrients a growing tree would need . In the middle of the hole I made the soil higher in the shape of an upside down cone . I took the tree out of my truck and removed it from the pot . I stood the tree up in the middle of the hole , with the tree on the top of the cone and the roots spread out around it . This would make sure the tree would not be standing in water and the roots could drink the water easily . I replaced the dirt , making sure the tree was even with the ground around the hole . When the hole was all filled up I stomped all around the tree to make sure the roots of the tree were firmly connected with the soil . When I was sure the tree was firmly in the ground and would not move , I got my garden hose . I turned on the water and slowly watered the tree . After a few hours , I watered it again . When all the water had sunk into the ground , I put a few inches of mulch all around the tree to keep the roots moist and stop weeds from growing . I knew that I would have to water the the tree every week until the roots got established . The tree will get bigger every year , and I 'm looking forward to the day when I 'll be able to pick cherries in my own back yard !",

We talked to the employees to find out which trees grow well in our area and in the type of soil we have . We chose a small maple seedling . When we got home , we chose an area of our yard with lots of sun . We dug a hole just a little bigger than the roots of our seedling . We put the seedling in the hole in the ground very carefully , then covered the roots with dirt . We patted the dirt down really good to make sure the little tree seedling would be stable in the ground when it was windy . Then we watered the tree . We 've been watching and watering our tree for a year and slowly but surely our little tree is growing .",

                "text": "I flew from Amsterdam to New York City last week . I had purchased and reserved my ticket a week in advance . I left the hostel I was staying and arrived at Schiphol Airport at about 21:00 . After waiting about 2 hours for the flight check-in , I boarded the plane . I went to and found my seat , located on the left-hand side near the middle of the plane . I placed some of my hand luggage in an overhead compartment and sat down next to another passenger who was seated to my right . I watched the rest of remaining passengers who were heading to their seats . About 20 minutes later , once everyone was seated and were given basic safety instructions by the flight attendants , the pilot announced that the we were now going to take off for New York . The plane engines then started , and we were soon airborne with Amsterdam soon far below us . It was a evening flight , so I slept on and off for a little while , then began watching an in-flight movie . After about 3 hours , we were served a light dinner of a chicken entree , bread , and juice . The food was surprisingly tasty and I enjoyed it . After finishing my meal , I relaxed and occasionally looked out the window at the night sky , as well as occasionally chatting with the person sitting next to me . Finally , the pilot announced that we were approaching JFK airport . The plane touched down shortly afterwards , and we safely landed in New York .",

I found a chocolate cake recipe that looked very good . I was missing a few ingredients , so I made a quick run to the grocery store . Once I had what I needed , I got to work . First , I got out all of the baking pans that I would need to bake the cake . Then I got out all the ingredients and let them sit at room temperature for a bit . After prepping the pans , I preheated the oven and stirred the dry ingredients together . Then I added the butter , sugar , eggs , and flour . After everything was mixed well , I put the mixture in the pan and then put the pan in the oven . After 40 minutes , the cake was done . I let it cool and then added white frosting . My mom loved the cake .",

We wandered through the nursery and considered a few of our option . We did n't want a large tree , like a pine tree . We did n't want a small tree , like a Japanese maple . We wanted something in-between . When we spoke to one of the workers at the nursery , he suggested that we plant a crabapple . It would have green leaves , and would have white flowers in the spring . We took the tree home in the back of our truck . My husband used our shovel to dig a hole in the ground . It took him some time - you have to dig a pretty big hole when you plant a tree ! Then I helped him carry the tree over to the hole . We had to cut off the plastic bucket it was in . When we were done , we put it in the hole , and I helped by holding the tree steady and pushing dirt into the hole . Once we had filled in all the dirt around the tree , we turned on the sprinklers . We wanted to water the tree and get it off to a good start . We were excited to have a new tree in the front yard .",

                "text": "Last spring , I planted a tree in my backyard . When I was a kid , we always had apples , because we had two apple trees in our backyard . We used to make pies and applesauce and I wanted to have that at my house . I went to the local nursery and I found a 6 foot tree . With delivery , it was pretty expensive , but I figured it was worth it . I dug out an area in my backyard . I was surprised at how long it took and how much dirt that I had to move . Digging the hole took me the longest time of the whole process . I finally got that done and I stuck the tree in the ground . I read online about a fertilizer that was good for apple trees and mixed that in with the dirt as I was filling in the area around the roots . I do n't expect to get any apples this year and probably not next year , but the tree should be mature enough to start producing apples in the following years . The whole process took me about 3 hours to get the tree planted . I wish I would have paid someone to do it for me .",

                "text": "The other day I decided to bake a cake so I got out some flour , eggs , sugar , and frosting . Once I mixed all of the ingredients together I put them in a pan and into an oven and set the oven to 400 degrees . I put the cake into the oven and set the cooking alarm for 12 minutes . Once the cake was fully cooked and the cooking alarm rang I took the cake out of the oven and let it cool off for a couple of minutes . After those couple of minutes were up I took some frosting after taking the cake out of the cooking pan and onto a plate , which just happened to be chocolate , and spread it over the cake lightly with a butter knife . Once I had completely covered the cake in frosting I put it gently into a box and put it into the fridge until I wanted to eat it . Once I ate it tasted really very good . '' , Nice Task Thanks",

I had to see which ones needed certain levels of care , look up different tree diseases , and the prices of some trees . I had to find something that would work well in my yard . When we finally picked a perfect tree , we had to take it home . It was very heavy ! Once we had it home , we had to dig a very big hole . After you roll the tree into the hole , you have to do something called facing the tree , which means you put the tree in the position you are happy with the already existing branches growing . You do n't want a huge branch going right toward your house ! To make facing easier , you should fill the hole halfway with water before putting the tree inside . After you face the tree , fill in the dirt , and pat yourself on the back for a job well done .",

I parked in long term parking and then took a shuttle to actual terminals . I felt so nervous that I would n't make my flight ! I was so afraid beforehand of getting my bag lost that I just packed everything I needed into a small carry on bag . I checked in and then went to security . Security moved along quickly and I was waiting at my gate to catch my flight . JFK airport is pretty gross ! While I was waiting , I had a beer at a restaurant . A roach fell on my husband who was with me ! We quietly called our server over and she stepped on it and told us it happens all the time ! We were so disgusted . It actually made us want to get on the plane even quicker and get out of there . Finally , we boarded the plane and were seated next to some nice people from Oregon . We chatted a bit with them and I watched an in-flight movie of Jane Eyre . Finally we got to Iceland . I loved flying !",

We will plant these trees in an effort to promote environmental sustainability , and to do our part as one in a millions ' chance to help the environment . Damage is being caused to the environment and local ecosystems at an alarming rate and we should all join together to do what we can in promoting awareness and getting the word out that we need to change our ways to help protect our environment .

I always feel so much better when I am clean and smell like my favorite soap . I like to fill the tub up as full as I can and pick a shower gel or bubble bath to make lots and lots of bubbles . I just soak in the bubbles and enjoy the time to myself . Then I wash my hair with shampoo and conditioner . Next , I make sure to scrub everywhere from between my toes to behind my ears with soap . After that , I am ready to dry off and get into some clean clothes . If I do n't have time for a bath , I just take a shower . Showers are much faster ! No matter what I choose , I make sure to take a bath or a shower every day .",

He loves tractors and anything related to farms , so I wanted to include that when I decorated the cake . I decided to make a cake with three layers since he was going to be three years old . I started by finding recipes for both chocolate and yellow cake since I knew that those were his favorites . I made the batter for the chocolate cake in one bowl and then the batter for the yellow cake in another bowl . I poured some chocolate cake batter in the largest and the smallest round baking pans since the top and bottom layers would be chocolate . I poured yellow cake batter in the medium-sized round baking pan since it would be the middle layer . I baked all three cakes and then cooled them . After they cooled , I stacked the cakes according to size and I frosted the bottom and top layers with yellow frosting and the middle layer with green frosting . I decorated the top of the cake with farm animals , a small toy tractor and the words , '' `` Happy Birthday Samuel . '' '' I topped off the cake with a number 3 candle . My nephew was very happy when he saw the cake . He was very surprised that I had baked a cake for him .",

We had a great time , but were very sweaty , sandy and sticky with old sunscreen , sweat and salt from the ocean . After unpacking the car , I had to take a bath . I love our deep soaking tub . I put in the drain plug and started running the water , making sure the temperature of the water was just right , and put in my favorite bath scents and soap . When the tub was full , I immersed myself deep into the tub and just let my body soak for a while . It was good to sit in the nice , warm water and let everything just relax and melt away from me . I washed my hair with my favorite shampoo , as I had a lot of sand in it from playing at the beach that day . I scrubbed my body well with a washcloth , to get off all the sand and ocean salt that had dried on my skin , along with the sunscreen that I had been using . It was very relaxing and I felt really good . I then pulled the drain on the tub and let all the dirty water go down . I had a big , fluffy bath towel that I dried off in , and I put on clean clothes . I was ready to finish up our fun day with some dinner and good times with my family .",

I have no issues flying a plane . I usually fly it constantly when I visit my friends in Florida . My cousins , on the other hand , were n't too keen on flying . They were very nervous on the plane . I had to calm them down . The food we received helped calm their nerves . Eating distracted them a little from our environment . Everything was fine until the plane started to experience a lot of turbulence . My cousins started to get afraid again . In fact , the turbulence was so bad , I started to feel afraid as well . Soon , the pilot announced that there was nothing to worry about . A couple minutes later , the plane flew smoothly again . Eight hours later , we arrived at Mexico . We were not only excited to be in Mexico , but we were excited to be on solid ground again .",

Planting fruit bearing trees was thought to be a good way to achieve these goals as well as letting the participants learn more about where food sources come from . Research was done into finding trees that would bear fruit in the season that the camp was most used . as well as having the requirements of water and sunlight and soil work with the land at camp . Several trees were ordered , including a cherry tree . In the chosen location a hole was dug and the tree had the burlap removed from the root ball and it was placed in at the appropriate depth . The soil with a few amendments was replaced and grass seed was sprinkled on . The tree was watered as suggested and I was assigned to schedule future watering and monitor the tree for health and insect invasions .",

Sure enough , there was a small puncture , I must have run over something sharp while commuting home . I then went to the local bike shop and the man at the shop recommended that I buy a patch kit , since doing so is much cheaper than replacing the entire tube . The patch kit was very easy to use as the instructions were very details . First I added glue to the area and then put the patch on top . After holding the patch in place for a few minutes , I added a little talc . I also added a little talc to the inside of the tire . Once everything was set , I put the wheel back on the bike and everything was good as new .",

I then washed my hair , lathering the shampoo into my hair , then rinsing it off in the bath water . Next , I washed my whole body with a bar of soap .

Then I shook the roots of the tree to loosen them . Then I placed the tree in the hole . I used a shovel to replace the dirt back over the tree roots . Once satisfied the tree was firmly in the ground i dragged over the hose . New trees needs lots of water . I watered the tree until I was satisfied and then put mulch around the base . I also attached ropes to secure the young tree so it would n't fall over while it 's roots were still settling in . I also had a canval funnel installed to make sure water went right into the roots where it was need most . Once all was said and done i stepped back to admire my handy work .",

Once the tub was filled with water and bubbles , I took off my clothes and sat down in the tub . I submerged my body in the soapy water . I used a loofah to wash myself . I then sat back and relaxed in the tub for a while . I had put the book that I was reading on the side of the tub and I decided to read it . It was very relaxing .

                "text": "When I was a freshman in high school we each had the opportunity to buy an inexpensive tree as part of the Arbor Day holiday . Part of the proceeds for the purchase were going to plant more trees in town . The tree I had was some kind of evergreen tree and I planned to plant it in the front yard . I asked my Dad where it 'd be best to plant it and we picked a spot where there were some flowers , but no trees . In order to plant it I read the instructions that came with the tree and started by digging a hole that was about twice the size of the root ball of the tree . It was a small tree so this was not a big hole . I then tried to make the hole a good shape before putting in some moss and fill dirt . I watered the tree that day and made sure to water it each day for about a week until we had a good rain . The tree grew and became quite large . The one thing I did n't realize is that I should have planned better for how big the tree was going to get because it ended up shadowing over the flower planters a bit .",

I pour a glass of wine while the water runs , and bring it with me into the bathroom . Once the tub is full , I finally allow myself to get in . Ah , perfect ! I lay back and let the hours of work just slip away . Sometimes I 'll bring a book in with me and sink into a good story as the hot water dulls away any aches and pains . I sip on my wine and enjoy the soft popping bubbles around me . When I have finally had enough , I 'll slowly drain the tub , and then get up and dry off with a huge fluffy towel . After taking a bath I always feel refreshed and relaxed !",

I was a young kid so it was a bubble bath and I had some toys to play with . Either my mother or my father would wash my hair for me then they would help me wash the remainder of my body . But they just told me not to splash the water and to keep the water in the tub . I would play with my toys and get all clean in the bath tub . After a few years I learned how to wash my own hair and I would prefer to take a bath over a shower since it was more fun to sit and relax in the warm water and enjoy a fun evening . From the best of my memory , I remember that I always loved taking a bath . Then when I am done in the bath tub , I would get out and wrap up in a huge dry cotton towel and dry off !",

He had been advised by a tree expert , that the best time to plant it was in April or May . So about several weeks after Tom had moved into his new home , he went ahead to plant the tree in mid April . He first got and checked some maps to make sure he did n't mistakenly end up digging into any telephone or gas lines . Once he found a suitable spot to plant his new tree , Tom took a shovel and began preparing the hole to place it in . Next , he prepared the tree for planting by turning carefully upside down to remove it from the pot it came in . He then gently , placed the tree into the hole . Tom also filled the hole with some compost and manure to help the tree grow better . Once this was done , he filled up the hole completely and watered the tree . Finally , he placed mulch on top and then stopped to admire the beautiful new tree in his yard .",

After finding our seats on the passenger jet , we were instructed by the flight attendants what we needed to do in case of emergency , and well as show us how to use out seat belts correctly . We were instructed to turn off out electrical devices during take off . Before we knew it , we were in the sky , thousands of feet above the earth 's surface .

I figured that I should bake it myself since I do not bake fairly often . I looked throughout my pantry and realized I had everything I needed . I went ahead and made it the evening before using all of the ingredients . I mixed the flour , sugar , water , eggs and even made my own frosting and did n't use one from a can . It turned out very moist , sweet and very good tasting . The next day I brought the cake over to my family gathering and it was a big hit . Everyone seemed to enjoy it . Afterwards , my aunt and other family members thanked me very much . I was very happy with myself .",

I walked in and put a stopper in the bathtub drain , turning on a mix of hot and cold water and checking the temperature after a couple of seconds to make sure it was just right - I like my water a little bit hot , but not too hot ! After sitting and waiting for several minutes for the bathtub to fill , I turned it off and got in . After relaxing for a few minutes , I grabbed the body wash and rag I keep on the corner of the bathtub . I lathered it up and washed my arms , my legs , my back , and my front , letting the water in the tub rinse off any soap when I was done with a part . After that , I pulled the stopper and drained the tub , used the towel hanging in the bathroom to dry myself off , and put on a fresh , clean pair of clothes .",

I struggled to stay atop the bicycle but was fortunately able to keep my balance . I knew that I had to fix my tire in order to use the bike . I knew the local gas station was only a few blocks away so I decided to walk my bike there . The first thing I did was get something to tape up the hole . The manager gave me some sort of sticky resin in order to patch things up . I went to the air pump to put some air into the tire and once it was full I was ready to patch it up . I used the resin to cover the hole and the tire seemed as good as new . I rode the bike home and made sure to avoid rolling over anymore rocks .",

I quickly ordered a few online from their website and when they came I was overcome with excitement . I brought a Pink Potion one with a flower inside and a Blue Dream glitter one . I put the Hello Kitty tub stopper in my bath tub and ran my bathwater until the tub was halfway full . Then I dropped the bath bomb in the water and was anointed by the wonderful smell of lavender . The water in the tub fizzled with pretty blue glitter . I got in an soaked for more than an hour and got out feeling like a million bucks . I seemed to be a thousand times cleaner than I was before I got it . I even smelled great the whole entire day .",

I also poured some bubble bath into the tub as it was filling with water . It foamed up into lots of bubbles . When the tub was full enough , I turned off the water and got into the tub , being careful not to slip on the slippery porcelain . I lay back in the warm water and shut my eyes , relaxing . When the water started to get cold , I stood up and grabbed the towel from the curtain rod . I draped it around myself and then opened the tub 's drain so the water could drain out . I went off to get dressed , and when I was done I went back to the bathroom and turned the shower on for a minute so the bubbles would all go down the drain . I picked up my rubber ducky and gave him a squeeze until he quacked . Then I put him on the shelf until next time .",

I brought my two suitcases filled with clothes and necessities , along with my visa and other important travel documents . Once I got to the airport , I passed by security and they checked my bags for anything that was illegal or dangerous . Once I got past the checkpoint , I waited at a terminal for an hour . They began to call for my plane and I got on line . I gave the lady my visa and ticket and I boarded the airplane . I put the luggage above my head in the luggage department and sat down . My seat was next to a window so I was very happy about that . Soon a person sat down next to me . We were told to eventually put our seat belts on as we were ready to fly . We watched a short video on what to do in case we felt some turbulence and what to do in case of emergency . Then the airplane lifted off and I was scared at first , I felt some shaking but eventually we were in the air and everything was okay . Eventually they began to serve food . That was my favorite part . I love airplane food !",

Her favorite flavor is strawberry so I will make her a strawberry cake as a surprise . I began by getting the best strawberries and most delicious cake batter from the store I could find . When I arrived home I turned on the oven and began to make the batter . I mix the ingredients together and put the cake together . It then goes in the oven to bake and become golden and perfect for eating . I take the cake out after it has baked and put sprinkles on top and place the candles . I write on the cake happy birthday princess ! ! The next day I surprise her with the best cake that she has ever seen . She is so surprised that she faints ! After waking back up she enjoys the cake and tells me it is the best that she has had in years .",

I soaked in the water for a little while before I grabbed a bar of soap and scrubbed and cleaned my body with it . I also used some shampoo to clean my hair . After dipping into the water to rinse all the shampoo and soap off my body , I unplugged the drain and emptied the water from the tub . I got out and dried myself with a towel .

I found a shovel and a watering can . With my seeds and tools , I found a spot in my yard that looked like it would get enough sunshine . There , I dug a hole for the seeds . I put a few in , and covered dirt back on top . After that I patted the the mound of earth back down . Once that was done , I took my watering can and watered the seeds until the soil was fairly moist . After that , I went to put away gardening supplies . I planned to water my tree periodically .

Anyway , the last time I had to do this was when I 'd apparently ran over some random , sharp piece of metal that got stuck in my front tire . I had to get some sealant and a little oil for my tire pump . I flipped by bike upside down and used a wrench to take the whole tire off . I have an older bike , so it 's easier to do it this way . I deflated the tire and then I took the outer tire off . I removed the metal bit from the tire and the bladder . I sealed the bladder and had to wait for it to cure . The outer tire got a little bit of repair mix too . After the various mixes dried , I inflated the bladder a bit and put both the bladder and the tire back on the wheel . This took a while , since I had to make sure that it was well within the wheel well , so that the tire would stay on . The last thing I really had to do was fully inflate the bladder and put the tire back on the bike . It took a little while to do , but it was better than buying an all new tire .",

I do n't know a lot about making cakes , but I have a super-huge baking pan , an oven , and a big sweet tooth ! I left the house looking around various convenience stores for cake mix ; it was Christmas , so going to a big store and wasting a bunch of time was out of the question . I had to spend a whole hour checking for a store that had any cake mix left ! I finally settled on two boxes of butter cake mix and some pink lemonade frosting and took it all home . Since my pan was way too big for just one box , I had to follow the instructions and double every ingredient while making the batter and pouring it in . I preheated the oven , put the cake pan with the batter in to bake , and watched TV for a few hours while I waited for it to be done . I checked the cake several times with a toothpick to make sure it was fully baked . Once it was done , I took it out to cool and frosted it , and then cut the cake into several square pieces .

I had to get eggs , sugar , milk and peanut butter . I got out a big mixing bowl and mixed all the ingredients up with a big wooden spoon . I preheated the oven while I was mixing everything together . I had to wait a few minutes for the oven to be ready for the concoction sitting on my counter . I poured the batter into a cake pan and licked the spoon . I put the pan into the oven and waited 25 minutes . It smelled incredible while it was baking . I tested the moisture of the cake by sticking a toothpick into the middle . It was perfect . I let the cake cool for 30 minutes and then cut it into pieces . I shared it with my family and we all agreed it was one of the tastiest cakes we 've ever eaten .",

I wanted to find a tree that would last a quite long time . We found a nice pine tree that was just large enough to be a foot . We dug a nice hole in the ground , and insured the soil was the proper type to accept a tree of this size . It had to be nice and soft , and in a safe location where kids wo n't trample over it . I dug the hole about 4 '' '' deep and insured it was wide enough for the tree . We planted the tree and began to fill in the surrounding area of it with soil to make sure it would hold in place as perfect as possible . The tree looked perfect and was ready to withstand the first school year outside the new building .",

He lived in a small town about 2 hours by car north of the larger town when we kids lived with our mom . We would go visit my dad every other weekend . My grandfather was a pilot too and had a small plane . His was smaller , though , and only seated 2 people . It was fun to fly in because I got to sit in front and see out the front and watch him work the controls . When we flew with my dad , my stepmother sat in the front seat and all three of us kids sat in the back seat . We were small , so we all fit . There was n't much room for luggage , but my dad would load the luggage behind the back seat . Then he would do the preflight checks . Some of these were outside the plane , but most of them were done from the inside . He would radio the tower and ask for permission to take off . This was always very exciting . The takeoff was a little scary because in a plane that small you could really feel the wind and the forces of the take off . The flight itself was fairly boring because you could n't really see anything from the back . Sadly , I had bad motion sickness , and my main memory of the landings is throwing up down the back of my dad 's neck .",

I come home and welcome my ritual of taking a bath . I get my phone out and find my favorite Pandora station that matches my current mood . I then get the water rolling at a hot temperature . I get undressed and in the tub . I like to sit there for a while and reflect while I relax . After a few minutes I 'll lather my hair and clean it out . I might drain the tub and put in more water . Lastly I 'll soap off the nastiness of the gym .",

Last summer , I had a girls trip to the Carribean . We had to plan our trip including booking airplane tickets and booking hotels . We booked our airplane tickets online a few months before to get the best fare . We arrive at the airport a few hours beforehand for an international flight . We all pack lightly with one piece of luggage . After waiting at the airport for a while , we boarded our plane . The flight attendants and crew are friendly . We find out seats and try to as comfortable in the cramped seating of a packed flight full of passengers . We try to relax , buckle up for a four hour flight . During the four hour flight , we can sleep on watch tv or listen to music . And the crew will come around with drinks and snacks . After a necessary flight , we arrive at our destination safely .",

I thought carefully about the type of tree I wanted to grow , I needed something with lots of leaves that would grow quite fast as I could n't afford to buy a tree that was already grown . I did some research on the internet and decided that I would like a Japanese Maple tree with red leaves . I drove to the garden center and made my way to the tree section , where there were lots of lovely small Japanese Maples for sale already growing in pots . I found someone who worked there to advise me on the best way to plant the tree and how to care for it . After I had paid for it and chosen some special compost for trees , they helped me load the car and I drove home to plant it . I selected a good spot in the garden where it would have room to spread out and went into the garage to get my spade . I dug a hole wide and deep enough for the entire pot to fit into , and I laid the pot on it 's side , gently tugging on the tree to remove it from the pot . Once it was free , I shook the roots a little to free them up and planted the tree in the hole I had dug . Then I packed the sides of the roots with the compost , making sure the trunk stayed vertical as I was doing this . When I had finished I watered the new tree really well , making a puddle around the base of the trunk with my garden hose . Then it was time to sit back and imagine in a few years I would have a big leafy red maple providing lots of shade and color .",

                "text": "I like baking cakes with my granddaughter . I let her help pour in the ingredients and mix them together . I take a box of cake mix to her house so we can bake a cake together . We read the directions on the back of the box of cake mix . Then we get out everything needed to make the cake . We usually need eggs , cooking oil , and water or milk . We also need a cake pan , a large mixing bowl , a measuring cup , and a mixing spoon . Also it helps to make sure we have pot holders and a spatula . I pre-heat the oven to the temperature given in the directions . Then I grease or oil the cake pan so the cake does not stick to the pan . Usually the directions want me to add a little flour to the pan to coat the oil , but I like to use sugar instead because it does not leave the outside of the cake looking like flour . We start by carefully cracking the egg shell and pouring the egg into a small cup or bowl to make sure we do not have a bad egg . Then we pour it into the mixing bowl . If we need more than one egg , we do each one separately the same way . Then we measure out the amount of oil needed and pour it into the mixing bowl , too . Then my granddaughter mixes up the eggs and oil really well . Next , I measure out the amount of liquid -LRB- water or milk -RRB- called for in the directions . She adds the liquid to the egg and oil mixture and stirs it all up really well . Then we add the cake mix , a little at a time , stirring well to mix . Then I pour the cake batter into the baking pan and spread it evenly with a spatula . Next , I carefully put the cake pan into the oven and set a timer to check it to see if it is done . We check to see if it is done by putting a clean toothpick into the center of the cake . If it comes out with little or none of the cake batter stuck to the toothpick , it is done and ready to take out of the oven , using pot holders . If there is still gooey stuff on the toothpick , the cake needs to be baked a little longer and then tested again . We are eager to see how our cake turns out . We play games while we wait for it to cool . Then we taste a little piece before we put frosting on the rest of the cake .",

I preheated the oven as instructed by the recipe . I weighed the ingredients with the weighing scales . I cracked two eggs into the mixing bowl . I then poured the rest of the ingredients into the bowl . I mixed the ingredients for 5 minutes with an electric mixer . I poured the mixed ingredients into a cake tin and placed it in the oven . After 20 minutes the cake was finished and I removed it from the oven . I let it cool down for a few minutes while I made some icing . I poured the icing over the cooled down cake and decorated the cake with some edible glitter .",

I tossed the blueberries with sugar and put them in the baking dish . I then mixed butter and a little milk with the cake mix . I put it on top of the blueberries . I put it in the oven . It was supposed to be like a cobbler . The cake was pretty bad . The bottom was all watery and the cake mix was super mushy because of all the liquid . The first couple of bites were okay . That was about all anyone could eat . I even tried to get the juice out . I 'm tossing it this morning .",

After taking off my mud-encrusted boots , I tiptoed towards the bathroom , where I knew a relaxing bath was in my future . I drew the water as hot as I could , and quickly filled the tub halfway with water . I stripped my clothes , first taking off me pants , then my shirt , socks , and underwear . Two drops of lavender oil and two cups of epsom salt is what I put into the tub , balancing out the temperature with cold water until it was just perfect . I slowly dipped my foot into the tub , and found the feeling spectacular . I slowly sunk the rest of my body , and closed my eyes in a breath of sweet relief .",

When something like this happens , it can seem like a big deal , but is only a small inconvenience . I do n't even know how to repair a flat bicycle tire , but I know how I could do it myself . First , I would read about how to fix it and maybe look at a video from the internet . After I have learned how to repair it , I would go to the store to get some supplies . I would need the tools to fix it and a new tire or things to use for the repair . After arriving home , I would review the things I learned about how to repair the tire and I would follow the directions . Once it was repaired , I would test out the bicycle to make sure it was repaired and then I would clean up .",

I loaded the tree into the truck and drove it to my house . I grabbed a shovel from my garage , and I dug a hole in my backyard where I wanted the tree to go . I poured some special tree fertilizer into the hole that I had bought from the tree nursery . I then asked a friend to help me , because the tree was very big and heavy . Together we placed the tree in the hole . I then started to fill up the dirt around the tree . Halfway through filling it , I took a garden hose and poured water down the hole . When the water settled , I finished filling in the dirt . Over the dirt I placed a nice bed of mulch around the tree . I watered the tree once more , then stepped back to admire my work .",

Without doing this , you may dig down and hit a line , which can be lethal ! Once you know where to dig , select what type of tree you want . Take things into consideration such as how much sun it gets , what zone you are in , and how quickly you want it to grow . Dig a hole large enough for the tree and roots . Place the tree in the hole and then fill the hole back up with dirt . Many small trees will need support until they are bigger . This will ensure they grow tall and straight . It is crucial to keep the tree watered ! It will need a lot of water at first . Mulch is helpful to keep the soil moist . It 's also important to wait until the threat of a frost has passed or is not in the near future . Giving care to your new tree will ensure that it will grow big and strong !",

When we were almost there , I noticed that the front tire on my bicycle felt rather wobbly and was most likely flat . I was in luck however , as my friend had a bicycle repair kit and some spare tires . Once we arrived at my friend 's house , I asked my friend if he let me borrow his bicycle repair kit . First , I turned the bike over and removed the front tire and tube . Next I filled the tube with air to check where the tube was damaged , and found a small glass shard which had punctured through it . After making ensure the tube was fully deflated , I repaired the puncture in the tube by using glue and applying a patch on top , then slid it back onto the tire using my hands . Next , I placed and pushed the tire back onto the tube . After which , I reconnected the tire onto the bicycle . Finally , I pumped air into the tire until it was filled up and the bicycle was ready to be ridden again .",

I always kept it with me on rides just in case of such an occurrence . I got off and went to the side of the trail out of the way of other bikers and runners . I lay the bike on its side and got the repair kit out of the pouch . The repair kit contained a new inner tube which I inflated . I then pulled the outer tire off of the inner tube . I replaced the flattened inner tube with the new one and replaced the outer tire over it . I rode off slowly to make sure everything was correctly in place . Once I got home , I replaced the spare tire kit with a new one so that I would be prepared on my next ride .",

Maybe this was a hasty decision since I have no experience baking cakes . So I looked online to see what I needed to do . I found a recipe that looked easy enough , so later that day I drove over to the grocery store to buy all the ingredients I would need to bake the cake . When I got to the store I started gathering up everything I needed . Once I almost had everything I turned down an aisle and noticed there were boxed of pre-made cake mix I could buy . This seemed like an easy option , so I put all the ingredients back and bought one of those mixes . I got home and started baking . All I needed to add to the mix was a couple eggs and some vegetable oil . After it was in the oven for an hour the cake was ready .",

I turned the water off and got into the nice hot relaxing tub of water . I added some bath soap into the tub and proceeded to scrub the dirt off my body with a washcloth . After washing myself and relaxing a bit I unclog the drain and watch the dirty soapy water spiral down the drain . I rinse body quickly in the shower to rinse the soap off . I get out and grab a towel to dry myself . I put on a clean set of clothes and feel fresh .",

I searched youtube to find a good simple but interesting set of instructions . I decided on a chocolate cake as I am weak when it comes to resisting chocolate . I gathered all of the ingredients and placed them on the counter along with measuring cups and spoons . I could not believe how much sugar goes into the baking of a cake but that 's why it 's not a health food . All the ingredients went into a bowl for me to mix with a 1980 's hand held electric mixer . While the over was preheating I scooped a the mixture into a well greased baking pan . Naturally my finger stole a taste of the raw cake . After placing the bowl in the oven and and waiting the proper time I removed the cake and frosted it after it cooled down . Not too bad for a non baker but I 'll stick to cooking .",

I pulled up a recipe on my tablet and started collecting all the ingredients . Once I had everything on the counter , I looked at what measures I would need and got out the cups and teaspoons and all the bowls I 'd need to mix it in . I started by measuring out the dry ingredients like flour and sugar and put them in the bowl . Then I added things like the eggs and milk and mixed it all up using my electric mixer . About halfway through I turned the oven on to preheat . I finished mixing everything and got it into the cake pan . I set a timer and stated putting the dirty dished in the sink to wash . I decided that they would keep for a little while and waited until later that night . When the cake was done I let it cool off and put chocolate frosting on it . Everyone agreed it was a really good cake , and washing the dishes was n't that hard . I think I 'll bake a little more often .",

He lives there and said that he would pick us up from the airport . But , the weather here was cold and there was freezing rain , so our flight was delayed for two hours . It was kind of scary taking off because the weather was still cold and rainy , but after two hours of sitting there waiting , I was ready to go . People on the flight were pretty happy to finally leave and a lot of people were having drinks . Everyone was getting ready for their own little party in Las Vegas . The flight itself took a little over four hours due to the fact that we had a non-stop flight . I was glad I paid the extra money for not making any stops . Six hours sitting on an airplane is more than enough for me . The flight was pretty uneventful except for the lively passengers , so that was a good thing , especially since my wife hates to fly . My friend ended up still picking us up from the airport and we had a great time in Las Vegas .",
